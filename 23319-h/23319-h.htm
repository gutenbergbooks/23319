<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>
The object of this book is to enable the beginner to learn to
make simple mechanical drawings without the aid of an instructor,
and to create an interest in the subject by giving examples
such as the machinist meets with in his every-day workshop practice.
The plan of representing in many examples the pencil lines, and
numbering the order in which they are marked, the author believes
to possess great advantages for the learner, since it is the producing
of the pencil lines that really proves the study, the inking in being
merely a curtailed repetition of the pencilling. Similarly when
the drawing of a piece, such, for example, as a fully developed
screw thread, is shown fully developed from end to end, even though
the pencil lines were all shown, yet the process of construction will
be less clear than if the process of development be shown gradually
along the drawing. Thus beginning at an end of the example the
first pencil lines only may be shown, and as the pencilling progresses
to the right-hand, the development may progress so that
at the other or left-hand end, the finished inked in and shaded
thread may be shown, and between these two ends will be found a
part showing each stage of development of the thread, all the lines
being numbered in the order in which they were marked. This
prevents a confusion of lines, and makes it more easy to follow or
to copy the drawing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[iv]</span>
It is the numerous inquiries from working machinists for a book of
this kind that have led the author to its production, which he hopes
and believes will meet the want thus indicated, giving to the learner
a sufficiently practical knowledge of mechanical drawing to enable
him to proceed further by copying such drawings as he may be
able to obtain, or by the aid of some of the more expensive and
elaborate books already published on the subject.</p>

<p>He believes that in learning mechanical drawing without the aid
of an instructor the chief difficulty is overcome when the learner
has become sufficiently familiar with the instruments to be enabled
to use them without hesitation or difficulty, and it is to attain this
end that the chapter on plotting mechanical motions and the succeeding
examples have been introduced; these forming studies that
are easily followed by the beginner; while sufficiently interesting to
afford to the student pleasure as well as profit.</p>

<h4><i>THE DRAWING BOARD.</i></h4>


<p>A Drawing Board should be of soft pine and free from knots, so that it
will easily receive the pins or tacks used to fasten down the paper. Its
surface should be flat and level, or a little rounding, so that the
paper shall lie close to its surface, which is one of the first
requisites requisites in making a good drawing. Its edges should be
straight and at a right angle one to the other, and the ends of the
battens B B in Figure 1<span class='pagenum'><a name="page18"
id="page18"></a>[18]</span>should fall a little short of the edge A
of the board, so that if the latter shrinks they will not protrude. The
size of the board of course depends upon the size of the paper, hence it
is best to obtain a board as small as will answer for the size of paper
it is intended to use. The student will find it most convenient as well
as cheapest to learn on small drawings rather than large ones, since
they take less time to make, and cost less for paper; and although they
require more skill to make, yet are preferable for the beginner, because
he does not require to reach so far over the board, and furthermore,
they teach him more quickly and effectively. He who can make a fair
drawing having short lines and small curves can make a better one if it
has large curves, etc., because it is easier to draw a large than a very
small circle or curve. It is unnecessary to enter into a description of
the various kinds of drawing boards in use, because if the student
purchases one he will be duly informed of the kinds and their special
features, while if he intends to make one the sketch in Figure 1 will
give him all the information he requires, save that, as before noted,
the wood must be soft pine, well seasoned and free from knots, while the
battens B should be dovetailed in and the face of the board trued after
they are glued and driven in. To true the edges square, it is best to
make the two longest edges parallel and straight, and then the ends may
be squared from those long edges.</p>

<p>THE <b>T</b> SQUARE.</p>

<p>Drawing squares or T squares, as they are termed,
are made of wood, of hard rubber and of steel.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>There are several kinds of T squares; in one the
blade is solid, as it is shown in Figure 5 on page 20; in
another the back of the square is pivoted, so that the
blade can be set to draw lines at an angle as well as
across the board, which is often very convenient,
although this double back prevents the triangles, when
used in some positions, from coming close enough to
the left hand side of the board. In an improved
form of steel square, with pivoted blade, shown in
Figure 2, the back is provided with a half circle divided
into the degrees of a circle, so that the blade can be
set to any required degree of angle at once.</p>

<p>THE TRIANGLES.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 5.</span>
</div>

<p>Two triangles are all that are absolutely necessary
for a beginner. The first is that shown in Figure 3,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[20]</span>
which is called a triangle of 45 degrees, because its
edge A is at that angle to edges B and C. That in
Figure 4 is called a triangle of 60 degrees, its edge A
being at 60 degrees to B, and at 30 degrees to C. The
edges P and C are at a right angle or an angle of 90
degrees in both figures; hence they are in this respect
alike. By means of these triangles alone, a great
many straight line drawings may be made with ease
without the use of a drawing square; but it is better
for the beginner to use the square at first. The manner
of using these triangles with the square is shown
in Figure 5, in which the triangle, Figure 3, is shown in
three positions marked D E F, and that shown in Figure
4 is shown in three positions, marked respectively
G H and I. It is obvious, however, that by turning
I over, end for end, another position is attained. The
usefulness in these particular triangles is because in
the various positions shown they are capable of use
for drawing a very large proportion of the lines that
occur in mechanical drawing. The principal requirement
in their use is to hold them firmly to the square-blade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[21]</span>
without moving it, and without permitting them
to move upon it. The learner will find that this is
best attained by so regulating the height of the
square-blade that the line to be drawn does not come
down too near the bottom of the triangle or edge of
the square-blade, nor too high on the triangle; that is
to say, too near its uppermost point. It is the left-hand
edge of the triangle that is used, whenever it can
be done, to produce the required line.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 6.</span>
</div>


<p>CURVES.</p>

<p>To draw curves that are not formed of arcs or parts of circles,
templates called curves are provided, examples of these forms being
given in Figure 6. They are made in wood and in hard rubber, the latter
being most durable; their uses are so obvious as to require no
explanation. It may be remarked, however, that the use of curves gives
excellent practice, because they must be adjusted very accurately to
produce good results, and the drawing pen must be held in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[22]</span>
same vertical plane, or the curve drawn will not be true in its outline.</p>


<p>DRAWING INSTRUMENTS.</p>

<p>It is not intended or necessary to enter into an
elaborate discussion of the various kinds of drawing
instruments, since the purchaser can obtain a good
set of drawing instruments from a reputable dealer by
paying a proportionate price, and must <i>per force</i> learn
to use such as his means enable him to purchase.
It is recommended that the beginner purchase as
good a set of instruments as his means will permit,
and that if his means are limited he purchase less
than a full set of instruments, having the same of good
quality.</p>

<p>All the instruments that need be used in the examples
of this book are as follows:</p>

<p>A small spring bow-pen for circles, a lining pen or
pen for straight lines, a small spring bow-pencil for
circles, a large bow-pen with a removable leg to replace
by a divider leg or a pencil leg, and having an
extension piece to increase its capacity.</p>

<p>The spring bow-pen should have a stiff spring, and
should be opened out to its full capacity to see that
the spring acts well when so opened out, keeping the
legs stiff when opened for the larger diameters. The
purchaser should see that the joint for opening and
closing the legs is an easy but not a loose fit on the
screw, and that the legs will not move sideways. To
test this latter, which is of great importance in the
spring bow-pencil as well as in the pen, it is well to
close the legs nearly together and taking one leg in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[23]</span>
one hand and the other leg in the other hand (between
the forefinger and thumb), pushing and pulling them
sideways, any motion in that direction being sufficient
to condemn the instrument. It is safest and best to
have the two legs of the bow-pen and pencil made
from one piece of metal, and not of two separate
pieces screwed together at the top, as the screw will
rarely hold them firmly together. The points should
be long and fine, and as round as possible. In very
small instruments separate points that are fastened
with a screw are objectionable, because, in very small
circles, they hide the point and make it difficult to apply
the instrument to the exact proper point or spot
on the drawing.</p>

<p>The joints of the large bow or circle-pen should
also be somewhat stiff, and quite free from side motion,
and the extension piece should be rigidly secured
when held by the screw. It is a good plan in purchasing
to put in the extension piece, open the joint
and the pen to their fullest, and draw a circle, moving
the pen in one direction, and then redraw it, moving it
in the other direction, and if one line only appears and
that not thickened by the second drawing, the pen is a
good one.</p>

<p>The lead pencil should be of hard lead, and it is
recommended that they be of the H, H, H, H, H, H,
in the English grades, which corresponds to the V, V,
H, of the Dixon grade. The pencil lines should be
made as lightly as possible; first, because the presence
of the lead on the paper tends to prevent the ink
from passing to the paper; and, secondly, because in
rubbing out the pencil lines the ink lines are reduced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[24]</span>
in blackness and the surface of the paper becomes
roughened, so that it will soil easier and be
harder to clean. In order to produce fine pencil lines
without requiring a very frequent
sharpening of the pencil it is best
to sharpen the pencil as in Figures
7 and 8, so that the edge shall be
long in the direction in which it is
moved, which is denoted by the
arrow in Figure 7. But when very
fine work is to be done, as in the
case of Patent Office drawings, a
long, round point is preferable, because
the eye can see plainer just
where the pencil will begin to
mark and leave off; hence the pencil lines will not be
so liable to overrun.</p>

<p>In place of the ordinary wood-covered lead pencils
there may be obtained at the drawing material stores
pencil holders for holding the fine, round sticks of
lead, and these are by far the best for a learner. They
are easier to sharpen, and will slip in the holder, giving
warning when the draftsman is pressing them too hard
on the paper, as he is apt to do. The best method of
trimming these leads, as also lead pencils after they
have been roughly shaped, is with a small fine file,
holding the file still and moving the pencil; or a good
piece of emery paper or sand paper is good, moving
the pencil as before.</p>

<p>All lines in pencilling as in inking in should begin at
the left hand and be drawn towards the right, or when
triangles are used the lines are begun at the bottom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[25]</span>
and drawn towards the top or away from the operator.
The rubber used should not be of a harsh grade, since
that will roughen the face of the paper and probably
cause the ink to run. The less rubbing out the better
the learner will progress, and the more satisfaction
he will receive from the results. If it becomes necessary
to scratch out it is best done with a penknife
well sharpened, and not applied too forcibly to the
paper but somewhat lightly, and moved in different
and not all in one direction. After the penknife the
rubber may sometimes be used to advantage, since it
will, if of a smooth grade, leave the paper smoother
than the knife. Finally, before inking in, the surface
that has been scraped should be condensed again by
rubbing some clean, hard substance over it which will
prevent the ink from spreading. The end of a paper-cutter
or the end of a rounded ivory handled drawing
instrument is excellent for this purpose.</p>

</div>

<p>It is well to use the rubber for general purposes in
such a way as to fit it for special purposes; thus,
in cleaning the sheet of paper, the rubber may be
applied first, as in Figure 9, as at A, and then as at B,
and if it be moved sideways at the same time it will
wear to the form shown in Figure 10, which will enable
it to be applied along a line that may require to be
rubbed out without removing other and neighboring
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[26]</span>
lines. If the rubber is in the form of a square stick
one end may be bevelled, as in Figure 11, which is an
excellent form, or it may be made to have a point, as
in Figure 12. The object is in each case to enable
the rubber action to be confined to the desired location
on the paper, so as to destroy its smooth surface
as little as possible.</p>

</div>

<p>For simple cleaning purposes, or to efface the pencil
lines when they are drawn very lightly, squares of
sponge-rubber answer admirably, these being furnished
by the dealers in drawing materials.</p>

<p>A piece of bread will answer a similar purpose, but
it is less convenient.</p>

<p>For glazed surface paper, as Bristol-board, the
smoothest rubber must be used, the grade termed
velvet rubber answering well.</p>


<p>THE DRAWING PAPER.</p>

<p>Whatever kind of drawing paper be used it should
be kept dry, or the ink, however good it may be, will
be apt to run and make a thick line that will not have
the sharp, clean edges necessary to make lines look
well.</p>

<p>Drawing paper is made in various qualities, kinds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[27]</span>
and forms, as follows: The sizes and names of paper
made in sheets are:</p>

<p>the thickness of the sheets increasing with their
size. Some sheets of paper are hot pressed, to give a
smoother surface, and thus enable cleaner-edged lines
to be drawn.</p>

<p>For large drawings paper is made in rolls of various widths, but as
rolled paper is troublesome to lay flat upon the drawing board, it is
recommended to the learner to obtain the sheets, which may be laid
sufficiently flat by means of broad headed pins, such as shown in Figure
13, which are called thumb tacks. These are forced through the paper
into the board at each corner, as in Figure 14 at <i>f</i>. On account of the
large diameter of the stems of these thumb tacks, which unduly pierce
and damage the board, and on account also of their heads, by reason of
their thickness, coming in the way of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[28]</span>
square blade, it will be found preferable to use the smallest sizes of
ordinary iron tacks, with flat heads, whose stems are much finer and
heads much thinner than thumb tacks. The objection to ordinary tacks is
that they are more difficult to remove, but they are, as stated, more
desirable for use.</p>

<p>If the paper is nearly the full size of the board, it
does not much matter as to its precise location on the
board, but otherwise it is best to place it as near the
left-hand edge of the board as convenient, as is shown
in Figure 14.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>The lower edge, D, Figure 15, of the paper, however,
should not be placed too near the edge, A, of the
board, because if the end P of the square back comes
down below the edge of the board, it is more difficult
to keep the square back true against the end of the
board.</p>

<p>The paper must lie flat upon and close to the surface
of the board, and a sufficient number of tacks
must be used to effect this purpose.</p>

<p>Drawings that are to be intricate, or to contain a
great many lines, as a drawing of an engine or of a machine,
are best pasted or glued all around the edges of
the paper, which should first be dampened; but as the
learner will scarcely require to make such drawings
until he is somewhat familiar with and well practised
in the use of the instruments, this part of the subject
need not be treated here.</p>


<p>TRACING PAPER.</p>

<p>For taking tracings from drawings tracing paper or
tracing cloth is used. They require to be stretched
tightly and without wrinkles upon the drawing. To
effect this object the mucilage should be thick, and
the tracing paper should be dampened with a sponge
after it is pasted. It must be thoroughly dry before
use, or the ink will run.</p>

<p>Tracing cloth must be fastened by pins or thumb
tacks, and not dampened. The drawing should be
made on the polished side of the cloth, and any coloring
to be done should be on the other side, and done
after the tracing is removed from the drawing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[30]</span></p>


<p>THE INK.</p>

<p>India ink should always be used for mechanical
drawing: First, because it lies upon and does not sink
into the paper, and is, therefore, easily erased; and,
secondly, because it does not corrode or injure the
drawing instruments.</p>

<p>India ink is prepared in two forms&mdash;in the stick and
in a liquid form. The stick ink is mixed in what are
termed saucers, or cabinet saucers, one being placed
above the other, so as to exclude the dust from settling
in it, and also to prevent the rapid evaporation
to which it is subject.</p>

<p>The surface of the saucer should be smooth, as any
roughness grinds the ink too coarsely, whereas the
finer it is ground or mixed the easier it will flow, the
less liability to clog the instruments, and the smoother
and more flat it will lie upon the paper. In mixing
the ink only a small quantity of water should be used,
the stick of ink being pressed <i>lightly</i> upon the saucer
and moved quickly, the grinding being continued
until the ink is mixed quite thickly. This will grind
the ink fine as it is mixed, and more water may be
added to thin it. It is best, however, to let the ink
be somewhat thick for use, and to keep it covered
when not in use; and though water may be added if
it gets too thick, yet ink that has once dried should
not be mixed up again, as it will not work so well
after having once dried.</p>

<p>Of liquid inks the Higgins ink is by far the best,
being quite equal to and much more convenient for
use than the best stick ink.<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The difference between a good and an inferior India
ink lies chiefly in the extent to which the lamp-black,
which is the coloring matter, forms with the water a
chemical solution rather than a mechanical mixture.
In inferior ink the lamp-black is more or less held in
suspension, and by prolonged exposure to the air will
separate, so that on being spread the solid particles
will aggregate by themselves and the water by itself.</p>

<p>This explains why draughtsmen will, after the ink
has been exposed to the air for an hour or two, add a
drop of mucilage to it; the mucilage thickening the
solution, adding weight to the water, and deferring
the separation of the lamp-black.</p>

<p>A good India ink is jet black, flows easily, lies close
to, does not stand upon or sink into the paper, and
has an even lustre, the latter being an indication of
fineness. The more perfect the incorporation of the
lamp-black with the water the easier the ink will flow,
the less liable it is to clog the instruments, the more
even and sharp the edges of the lines, and the finer
the lines that may be drawn.</p>

<p>Usually India ink can only be tested by actual trial;
but since it is desirable to test before purchasing it, it
may be mentioned that one method is to mix a little
on the finger nail, and if it has a "bronzy" gloss it is
a good indication. It should also spread out and dry
without any tendency to separate.</p>

<p>The best method of testing is to mix a very little,
and drop a single drop in a tumbler of clear water.
The best ink will diffuse itself over the surface, and if
the water is disturbed will diffuse itself through the
water, leaving it translucent and black, with a slight
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[32]</span>
tinge of bronze color. A coarser ink will act in a
similar manner, but make the water somewhat opaque,
with a blue-black, or dull, ashy color. A still coarser
ink will, when diffused over the surface of the water,
show fine specks, like black dust, on the surface. This
is readily apparent, showing that the mixture of the
ink is not homogeneous.</p>

<p>When it is an object to have the lines of a drawing
show as black as possible, as for drawings that are to
be photo-engraved, the ink should be mixed so thickly
as to have a tendency to lift when a body, such as a
lead pencil, is lifted out of it. For Patent Office drawings
some will mix it so thickly that under the above
test it appears a little stringy.</p>

<p>The thicker the ink can be used the better, because
the tendency of the carbon to separate is less; and it
is for this reason that the test mentioned with a tumbler
of water is so accurate. When ink is to be used
on parchment, or glossy tracing-paper, it will flow
perfectly if a few drops of ox-gall be mixed with it;
but on soft paper, or on bristol board, this will cause
the ink to spread.</p>

<p>For purposes of measurement, there are special
rules or scales of steel and of paper manufactured.
The steel rules are finely and accurately divided, and
some are of triangular form, so that when laid upon
the paper the lines divided will lie close to the paper,
and the light will fall directly on the ruled surface.
Triangular rules or scales are therefore much superior
to flat ones. The object of having a paper rule or
scale is, that the paper will expand and contract under
varying degrees of atmospheric moisture, the same as
the drawing paper does.<span class='pagenum'>
<a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>Figure 16 represents a triangular scale, having upon
it six different divisions of the inch. These are made
in different patterns, having either decimal divisions
or the vulgar fractions. Being made of steel, and
nickel-plated, they are proof against the moisture of
the fingers, and are not subject to the variation of
the wooden scale.</p>

<h3><i>THE PREPARATION AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.</i></h3>


<p>The points of drawing instruments require to be
very accurately prepared and shaped, to enable them
to make clean, clear lines. The object is to have the
points as sharp as they can be made without cutting
the paper, and the curves as even and regular as possible.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 40px;">
<a name="Fig_17" id="Fig_17"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 18.</span>
</div>

<p>The lining pen should be formed as in Figure 17,
which presents an edge and a front
view of the points. The inside
faces should be flat across, and
slightly curved in their lengths, as
shown. If this curve is too great,
as shown exaggerated in Figure 18, the body of the
ink lies too near the point and is apt to flow too freely,
running over the pen-point and making a thick, ragged
line. On the other hand, if the inside faces, between
which the ink lies, are too parallel and narrow near
the points, the ink dries in the pen, and renders a too
frequent cleaning necessary. Looking at the face of
the pen as at A in Figure 17, its point should have an
even curve, as shown, the edge being as sharp as it
can be made without cutting the drawing paper.
Upon this quality depends the fineness and cleanness
of the lines it will make. This thin edge should extend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[35]</span>
around the curve as far as the dotted line, so
that it will be practicable to slant the pen in either of
the directions shown in Figure 19; and it is obvious
that its thickness must be equal around the arc, so
that the same thickness of line will be drawn whether
the pen be held vertical or slanted in either direction.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<a name="Fig_19" id="Fig_19"></a>

<img src="images/drawing-0034-2.jpg" width="74" height="49" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 20.</span>
</div>

<p>The outside faces of the pen should be slightly
curved, so that when held vertically, as in Figure 20
(the dotted line representing the centre of the length
of the instrument), and against the square blade S,
the point will meet the paper a short distance from
the lower edge of S as shown. By this means it is
not necessary to adjust the square edge exactly coincident
with the line, but a little way from it. This is an
advantage for two reasons: first, the trouble of setting
the square-edge exactly coincident is avoided, and,
secondly, the liability of the ink to adhere to the edge
of the square-blade and flow on to the paper and
make a thick, ragged line, is prevented.</p>

<p>The square being set as near to the line as desired,
the handle may be held at such an angle that the pen-point
will just meet the line when sloped either as in
Figure 21 or 22. If, however, the slope be too much
in the direction shown in Figure 21, practice is necessary
to enable the drawing of straight lines if they be
long ones, because any variation in the angle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[36]</span>
instrument to the paper obviously vitiates the straightness
of the line. If, on the other hand, the square be
too close to the line, and the pen therefore requires
to be sloped as in Figure 22, the ink flowing from the
pen-point is apt to adhere to the square-edge, and the
result will be a ragged, thick line, as shown in Figure
23.</p>

<p>Each of the legs should be of equal thickness at
the pen-point edge, so that when closed together the
point will be in the middle of the edge. The width
and curve of each individual point should be quite
equal, and the easiest method of attaining this end is
as follows:</p>

<p>Take a small slip of Arkansas oil-stone, and with
the pen-points closed firmly by the screw trim the pen-edges
to the required curve as shown at A, Figure 17,
making the curve as even as possible. Then stone
the faces until this curve is brought up to a sharp
edge at the point between the two pen-legs forming
the point.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Next take a piece of 000 French emery paper, lay
it upon some flat body like the blade of a square, and
smooth the curve of the edge enough to take off the
fine, sharp edge left by the oil-stone; then apply the
outside flat faces of the pen to the emery paper again,
bringing the pen-edge up sharp.</p>

<p>The emery paper will simply have smoothed and
polished the surfaces, still leaving them too sharp, so
sharp as to cut the paper, and to take off this sharp
edge (which must first be done on the inside faces)
open the pen-points as wide as the screw will permit.
Then wrap one thickness of the emery paper upon a
thin blade, as upon a drawing-triangle, and pass the
open pen-points over it, and move the instrument endwise,
taking care to keep the inside face level with the
surface of the emery paper, so that the pen-points shall
not cut through. Next close the pen-points with the
screw until they nearly, but not quite, touch, and sweep
the edge of the pen-point along the emery paper under
a slight pressure, so moving the handle that at each
stroke the whole length around the curved end of the
pen will meet the emery surface. During this motion
the inside faces of the pen-point must be held as nearly
vertical as possible, so as to keep the two halves of the
pen-point equal.</p>

<p>The pen is now ready for use, and will draw a fine
and clean line.</p>

<p>It is not usual to employ emery paper for the purpose
indicated, but it will be found very desirable,
since it leaves a smoother surface and edge than the
oil-stone alone.</p>

<p>Circle-pens are more difficult to put in order than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[38]</span>
the straight-line pen, especially those for drawing the
smallest circles, which cannot be well drawn unless the
pen is of the precise right shape and in the best condition.</p>

<p>A circle-pen is shown in Figure 24, in which A represents
the point-leg and B the pen-leg. The point-leg
must be the longest because it requires to enter
the drawing paper before the pen meets the surface.
The point should be sharp and round, for any edges
or angles on it will cause it to widen the hole in the
paper when it is rotated. To shape the points to prevent
the enlargement of the centre in the paper is one
of the most important considerations in the use of this
instrument, especially when several circles require to
be drawn from the same centre. To accomplish this
end the inside of the point-leg should be, as near as
possible, parallel to the length of the instrument (which
is denoted in Figure 24 by the dotted line) when the
legs are closed, as in the figure. If the point is at
an angle, as shown in Figure 25, it is obvious that
rotating it will enlarge the top of the centre in the
drawing paper. The point should be sharp and smooth
on its circumferential surface, and so much longer than
the pen-point that it will have sufficient hold in the
paper when the instrument stands vertical and the
pen-point meets the surface of it, which amount is
about 1/64th of an inch.</p>

<p>We may now consider the shape of the pen-point.
Its inside surfaces should be flat across and to the curve
shown in Figure 24, not as shown exaggerated in Figure
25, because in the latter the body of the ink will
be too near the pen-point, and but little can be placed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[39]</span>
in it without causing it sometimes to flow over the
edges and down the outside of the pen.</p>

<p>A form of pen-point recently introduced is shaped
as in Figure 26, the object being to have a thin stream
of ink near the marking pen-point and the main body
of the ink near at hand, instead of extending up the
pen, as would be the case with Figure 24. The advantage
thus gained is that the ink lies in a more
solid body, and having less area of surface exposed to
the air will not dry so quickly in the pen; but this is
more than offset by the liability of the ink to flow over
the crook at A, and cause the pen to draw a thick
ragged line. The pen-point must be slightly inclined
toward the needle-point, to the end that they may approach
each other close enough for drawing very
small circles, but it should also stand as nearly vertical
as will permit that end to be attained. As this pen
is for drawing small circles only, it does not require
much ink, and hence may be somewhat close together,
as in Figure 24; this has the advantage that the point
is not hidden from observation.</p>

<p>In forming the pen-point the greatest refinement is
necessary to enable the drawing of very small true
circles, say 1/16th of an inch, or less, in diameter. The
requirements are that the pen-point shall meet the
surface of the paper when the needle-point has entered
it sufficiently to give the necessary support, and
that the instrument shall stand vertical, as shown by
the dotted line in Figure 24. Also, that the pen shall
then touch the paper at a point only, this point being
the apex of a fine curve; that this curve be equal on
each side of the point of contact with the paper; that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[40]</span>
both halves forming the pen be of equal thickness
and width at the pointed curve; and that the point be
as sharp as possible without cutting the paper.</p>

<p>The best method of attaining these ends is as follows:
On each side of the pen make, with an oil-stone,
a flat place, as C D, Figure 27 (where the pen-point
is shown magnified), thus bringing both halves to an
edge of exactly equal length, and leaving the point
flat at D. These flat places must be parallel to one
another and to the joint between the two halves of the
pen. As the oil-stone may leave a slightly ragged
edge, it is a good plan to take a piece of 00 French
emery paper, lay it on a flat surface, and holding the
instrument vertically remove the fine edge D until it
will not cut. Then with the oil-stone shape the
curved edge as in Figure 28, taking care that the
curve no more than brings the flat place D up to a
true curve and leaves the edge sharp, with only the
very point touching the paper, which is represented in
the cut by the horizontal line.</p>

<p>The point must have a sharp edge all around the
curve, and the two halves must be exactly equal in
width, for if one half is wider than the other, as in
Figure 29 at a, or as in Figure 30 at b, it will be impossible
to draw a very small circle true. So, likewise,
the two halves of the pen must be of exactly
<span class='pagenum'>[41]</span>
equal length, and not one half longer than the other,
as in Figures 31 or 32, which would tend to cut the
paper, and also render the drawing of true small circles
impracticable.</p>

<p>When the pen is closed to draw a very small circle
the two halves of the pen-leg should have an equal
degree of contact with the surface of the paper, and
then as the legs are opened out to draw larger circles
the contact of the outside half of the pen will have
less contact with the paper. The smaller the circle,
the more difficult it is to keep the point-leg from slipping
out of the centre, and the more difficult it is to
draw a clear line and true circle; hence the points
should be shaped to the best advantage for drawing
these small circles, by oil-stoning the pen, as already
described, and then finishing it as follows:</p>

<p>After the oil-stoning, open the two valves of the
pen-leg wide enough to admit a piece of 000 French
emery paper wrapped once around a very thin blade,
and move the pen endwise as described for the
straight-line pen. This will smooth the inner surfaces
and remove any fine wire-edge that the oil-stone may
leave. Close the two halves of the pen again, and
lightly emery-paper the outside faces, which will leave
the edge sharp enough to cut the paper. The removal
of the sharp edge still left, to the exact degree,
requires great care. It may best be done by closing
the pen until its two halves very nearly, but not quite,
touch, then adjust it to mark a circle of about 3/16 inch
diameter, and strike a number of circles in different
locations upon the surface of a piece of 0000 French
emery paper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>In marking these circles, however, let the instrument
stand out of the perpendicular, and do very little
while standing vertically. Indeed, it is well to strike
a number of half-circles, first from right to left and
then from left to right, and finally draw a full circle,
sloping the pen on one side, gradually raising it vertically,
and finally sloping it to the other side. This will
insure that the pen has contact at its extreme point,
and leave that point fine and keen, but not enough so
to cut the paper. To test the pen, draw small circles
with the pen rotated first in one direction and then in
the other, closing its points so as to mark a fine line,
which, if the pen is properly shaped, will be clear and
fine, while if improperly formed the circle drawn with
the pen rotated in one direction will not coincide with
that drawn while rotating it in the other. The same
circle may be drawn over several times to make a
thorough test. If a drawing instrument will draw a
fine line correctly, it will be found to answer for thick
lines which are more easily made.</p>

<p>In thus preparing the instruments, the operator will
find that if he occasionally holds the points in the
right position with regard to the light, he will be able
to see plainly if the work is proceeding evenly and
equally, for if one-half of the pen is thicker at the
point or edge than the other, it will show a brighter
line. This is especially the case with instruments that
have become dull by use, for in that case the edges
will be found quite bright, and any inequality of thickness
shows plainly.</p>

<p>It follows, from what has been said, that the needle-point
and pen-point should stand vertical when in use,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[43]</span>
and to effect this the instruments, except in the
smallest sizes, are provided with joints, such as shown
at A and B in the bow-pencil or circle-pencil, in Figure
33. These joints should be sufficiently stiff that
they will not move too easily, and yet will move rather
than that the legs should sensibly spring without
moving at the joint. The needle-point leg should be
adjusted by means of the joint, to stand vertical,
and the same remarks apply equally to the pen-leg;
but in the case of the pencil-leg it is the pencil
itself and not the leg that requires attention,
the joint B being so adjusted that the pencil either
stands vertical, or, what is perhaps preferable, so that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[44]</span>
it stands inclined slightly towards the needle-point.
In sharpening the pencil the inner face C may be made
concave or at least vertical and flat, and the outer convex
or else bevelled and flat, producing a fine and long
edge rounded in its length of edge. In using the circle-pencil
and circle-pen it will be found more convenient
to rotate it in the direction of the arrow in Figure 34.
It should be held lightly to the paper, and the learner will
find that he has a natural tendency to hold it too firmly
and press it too heavily, which is <i>especially to be avoided</i>.</p>

<p>If in drawing a small circle the needle-point slips
out of the paper, it is because the pencil-point is too
long; or, what is the same thing, the needle-point does
not protrude far enough out from the leg. Or if the
instrument requires to be leaned over too much to
make the pencil or pen mark, it is because the pen or
pencil is not far enough out, and this again may cause
the needle-point to slip out of the paper.</p>

<p>In Figure 35 is shown a German instrument especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[45]</span>
designed to avoid this slipping. The peculiarity
of this instrument consists in the arrangement of the
centre point, which remains stationary whilst the pen
or pencil, resting by its own weight on the paper, is
guided round by gently turning, without pressure,
the small knob at the upper end of the tube. By this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[46]</span>
means the misplacing or sliding of the centre-point
and the cutting of the paper by the pen are avoided.
By means of this fixed centre-point any number of
concentric circles may be drawn, without making a
hole of very distinguishable size on the paper.</p>

<p>In applying the ink to the bow-pen as to all other
instruments, care must be taken that the ink lies between
the points only and not on the outside, for in
the latter case the ink will flow down too freely and
make a broad, ragged line, perhaps getting on the
edge of the square blade or triangle, and causing a
blot of ink on the drawing.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>In using a straight line or lining pen with a T
square it may be used as in Figure 36, being nearly
vertical, as shown, and moved from left to right as denoted
by the arrow, S representing the square blade.
But in using it, or a pencil, with a straight edge or a
triangle unsupported by the square blade, the latter
should be steadied by letting the fingers rest upon it
while using the instrument, the operation being shown
in Figure 37. The position, Figure 36, is suitable for
long lines, and that in Figure 37 for small drawings,
where the pen requires close adjustment to the lines.

<p>Although the beginner will find that a study of
geometry is not essential to the production of such
elementary examples of mechanical drawing as are
given in this book, yet as more difficult examples are
essayed he will find such a study to be of great advantage
and assistance. Meantime the following explanation
of simple geometrical terms is all that is
necessary to an understanding of the examples given.</p>

<p>The shortest distance between two points is termed
the radius; and, in the case of a circle, means the distance
from the centre to the perimeter measured in a
straight line.</p>

<p>Dotted lines, thus, &lt;&mdash;&mdash;- &gt;, mean the direction and
the points at which a dimension is taken or marked.
Dotted lines, thus,&mdash;&mdash;-, simply connect the same
parts or lines in different views of the object. Thus in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[49]</span>
Figure 38 are a side and an end view of a rivet, and the
dotted lines show that the circles on the end view
correspond to the circle of the diameters of the head
and of the stem, and therefore represent their diameters
while showing that both are round. A straight
line is in geometry termed a right line.</p>

<p>A line at a right angle to another is said to be perpendicular
to it; thus, in Figures 39, 40, and 41, lines
A are in each case perpendicular to line B, or line B
is in each case perpendicular to line A.</p>

<p>A point is a position or location supposed to have
no size, and in cases where necessary is indicated by
a dot.</p>



<p>Parallel lines are those equidistant one from the
other throughout their length, as in Figure 42. Lines
maybe parallel though not straight; thus, in Figure 43,
the lines are parallel.</p>

<p>A line is said to be <i>produced</i> when it is extended
beyond its natural limits: thus, in Figure 44, lines A
and B are <i>produced</i> in the point C.</p>

<p>A line is bisected when the centre of its length is
marked: thus, line A in Figure 45 is bisected, at or in,
as it is termed, <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>The line bounding a circle is termed its circumference
or periphery and sometimes the perimeter.</p>

<p>A part of this circumference is termed an arc of a
circle or an arc; thus Figure 46 represents an arc.
When this arc has breadth it is termed a segment;
thus Figures 47 and 48 are segments of a circle. A
straight line cutting off an arc is termed the chord of
the arc; thus, in Figure 48, line A is the chord of the
arc.</p>

<p>A quadrant of a circle is one quarter of the same,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[51]</span>
being bounded on two of its sides by two radial lines,
as in Figure 49.</p>

<p>When the area of a circle that is enclosed within
two radial lines is either less or more than one quarter
of the whole area of the circle the figure is termed
a sector; thus, in Figure 50, A and B are both sectors
of a circle.</p>

<p>A straight line touching the perimeter of a circle is
said to be tangent to that circle, and the point at
which it touches is that to which it is tangent; thus, in
Figure 51, line A is tangent to the circle at point B.
The half of a circle is termed a semicircle; thus, in
Figure 52, A B and C are each a semicircle.</p>

<p>The point from which a circle or arc of a circle is

<i>b b</i> the axial line of the cylinder.</p>

F as a centre draw the semicircle O, and from G as

meeting the two ends of the respective lines D E.

M. Draw a line passing through M and F, and a line
passing through J and Q, and where these two lines
intersect, as at Q, is the centre of a circle R that will
pass through all three of the points A B and C.</p>

whose centre is to be found. From the extreme ends
of the arc bisect it in B. From end A draw the arc
C, and from B the arc D. Then from the end A
draw arc G, and from B the arc F. Draw line H
passing through the two points of intersections of
arcs C D, and line I passing through the two points
of intersection of F G, and where H and I meet, as
at J, is the centre from which the arc was drawn.</p>

<p>A degree of a circle is the 1/360 part of its circumference.
The whole circumference is supposed to be
divided into 360 equal divisions, which are called the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[53]</span>
degrees of a circle; but, as one-half of the circle is
simply a repetition of the other half, it is not necessary
for mechanical purposes to deal with more than
one-half, as is done in Figure 56. As the whole
circle contains 360 degrees, half of it will contain
one-half of that number, or 180; a quarter will
contain 90, and an eighth will contain 45 degrees.
In the protractors (as the instruments having the
degrees of a circle marked on them are termed)
made for sale the edges of the half-circle are marked
off into degrees and half-degrees; but it is sufficient
for the purpose of this explanation to divide off one
quarter by lines 10 degrees apart, and the other by lines
5 degrees apart. The diameter of the circle obviously
makes no difference in the number of decrees contained
in any portion of it. Thus, in the quarter
from 0 to 90, there are 90 degrees, as marked; but
suppose the diameter of the circle were that of inner
circle <i>d</i>, and one-quarter of it would still contain 90
degrees.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 284px;">
<a name="Fig_56" id="Fig_56"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0052-1.jpg" width="284" height="147" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 56.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>So, likewise, the degrees of one line to another are
not always taken from one point, as from the point O,
but from any one line to another. Thus the line
marked 120 is 60 degrees from line 180, or line 90 is
60 degrees from line 150. Similarly in the other
quarter of the circle 60 degrees are marked. This
may be explained further by stating that the point
O or zero may be situated at the point from which the
degrees of angle are to be taken. Here it may be
remarked that, to save writing the word "degrees,"
it is usual to place on the right and above the figures
a small &deg;, as is done in Figure 56, the 60&deg; meaning
sixty degrees, the &deg;, of course, standing for degrees.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 135px;">

<img src="images/drawing-0053-1.jpg" width="135" height="145" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 57.</span>
</div>

<p>Suppose, then, we are given two lines, as <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in
Figure 57, and are required to find their angle one to
the other. Then, if we have a protractor, we may
apply it to the lines and see how many degrees of
angle they contain. This word "contain" means how
many degrees of angle there are between the lines,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[55]</span>
which, in the absence of a protractor, we may find by
prolonging the lines until they meet in a point as at <i>c</i>.
From this point as a centre we draw a circle D, passing
through both lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>. All we now have to do is
to find what part, or how much of the circumference, of
the circle is enclosed within the two lines. In the example
we find it is the one-twelfth part; hence the
lines are 30 degrees apart, for, as the whole circle
contains 360, then one-twelfth must contain 30, because
360&divide;12 = 30.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 58.</span>
</div>

<p>If we have three lines, as lines A B and C in
Figure 58, we may find their angles one to the other
by projecting or prolonging the lines until they meet
as at points D, E, and F, and use these points as the centres
wherefrom to mark circles as G, H, and I. Then,
from circle H, we may, by dividing it, obtain the angle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[56]</span>
of A to B or of B to A. By dividing circle I we may
obtain the angle of A to C or of C to A, and by
dividing circle G we may obtain the angle of B to C
or of C to B.</p>

</div>

<p>It may happen, and, indeed, generally will do so,
that the first attempt will not succeed, because the
distance between the lines measured, or the arc of
the circle, will not divide the circle without having the
last division either too long or too short, in which
case the circle may be divided as follows: The compasses
set to its radius, or half its diameter, will
divide the circle into 6 equal divisions, and each of
these divisions will contain 60 degrees of angle, because
360 (the number of degrees in the whole
circle) &divide;6 (the number of divisions) = 60, the number
of degrees in each division. We may, therefore,
subdivide as many of the divisions as are necessary
for the two lines whose degrees of angle are to be
found. Thus, in Figure 59, are two lines, C, D, and
it is required to find their angle one to the other.
The circle is divided into six divisions, marked respectively
from 1 to 6, the division being made from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[57]</span>
the intersection of line C with the circle. As both lines
fall within less than a division, we subdivide that
division as by arcs <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, which divide it into three
equal divisions, of which the lines occupy one division.
Hence, it is clear that they are at an angle of 20
degrees, because twenty is one-third of sixty. When
the number of degrees of angle between two lines
is less than 90, the lines are said to form an acute
angle one to the other, but when they are at more
than 90 degrees of angle they are said to form an
obtuse angle. Thus, in Figure 60, A and C are at
an acute angle, while B and C are at an obtuse angle.
F and G form an acute angle one to the other, as also
do G and B, while H and A are at an obtuse angle.
Between I and J there are 90 degrees of angle;
hence they form neither an acute nor an obtuse
angle, but what is termed a right-angle, or an angle
of 90 degrees. E and B are at an obtuse angle.
Thus it will be perceived that it is the amount of inclination
of one line to another that determines its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[58]</span>
angle, irrespective of the positions of the lines, with
respect to the circle.</p>

<p>TRIANGLES.</p>

<p>A right-angled triangle is one in which two of the
sides are at a right angle one to the other. Figure
61 represents a right-angled triangle, A and B forming
a right angle. The side opposite, as C, is called the
hypothenuse. The other sides, A and B, are called
respectively the base and the perpendicular.</p>

<p>A figure that is bounded by four straight lines is
termed a quadrangle, quadrilateral or tetragon.
When opposite sides of the figure are parallel to each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[60]</span>
other it is termed a parallelogram, no matter what
the angle of the adjoining lines in the figure may be.
When all the angles are right angles, as in Figure 66,
the figure is called a rectangle. If the sides of a
rectangle are of equal length, as in Figure 67, the
figure is called a square. If two of the parallel sides
of a rectangle are longer than the other two sides, as
in Figure 66, it is called an oblong. If the length
of the sides of a parallelogram are all equal and
the angles are not right angles, as in Figure 68, it
is called a rhomb, rhombus or diamond. If two
of the parallel sides of a parallelogram are longer
than the other two, and the angles are not right
angles, as in Figure 69, it is called a rhomboid.
If two of the parallel sides of a quadrilateral are of
unequal lengths and the angles of the other two
sides are not equal, as in Figure 70, it is termed a
trapezoid.</p>

<p>The term polygon is applied to figures having flat
sides equidistant from a common centre. From this
centre a circle may be struck that will touch all the
corners of the sides of the polygon, or the point of
each side that is central in the length of the side. In
drawing a polygon, one of these circles is used upon
which to divide the figure into the requisite number
of divisions for the sides. When the dimension of
the polygon across its corners is given, the circle
drawn to that dimension circumscribes the polygon,
because the circle is without or outside of the polygon
and touches it at its corners only. When the dimension
across the flats of the polygon is given, or when
the dimension given is that of a circle that can be
inscribed or marked within the polygon, touching its
sides but not passing through them, then the polygon
circumscribes or envelops the circle, and the circle is
inscribed or marked within the polygon. Thus, in
Figure 71 <i>a</i>, the circle is inscribed within the polygon,
while in Figure 72 the polygon is circumscribed by
the circle; the first is therefore a circumscribed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[62]</span>
the second an inscribed polygon. A regular polygon
is one the sides of which are all of an equal
length.</p>

<p>The angles of regular polygons are designated by
their degrees of angle, "at the centre" and "at the
circumference." By the angle at the centre is meant
the angle of a side to a radial line; thus in Figure 73
is a hexagon, and at C is a radial line; thus the angle
of the side D to C is 60 degrees. Or if at the two
ends of a side, as A, two radial lines be drawn, as B,
C, then the angles of these two lines, one to the other,
will be the "angle at the centre." The angle at the
circumference is the angle of one side to its next
neighbor; thus the angle at the circumference in a
hexagon is 120 degrees, as shown in the figure for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[63]</span>
the sides E, F. It is obvious that as all the sides are
of equal length, they are all at the same angle both
to the centre and to one another. In Figure 74 is a
trigon, the angles at its centre being 120, and the
angle at the circumference being 60, as marked.</p>

<p>THE ELLIPSE.</p>

<p>An ellipse is a figure bounded by a continuous
curve, whose nature will be shown presently.</p>

<p>The dimensions of an ellipse are taken at its extreme
length and narrowest width, and they are designated
in three ways, as by the length and breadth,
by the major and minor axis (the major axis meaning
the length, and the minor the breadth of the figure),
and the conjugate and transverse diameters, the transverse
meaning the shortest, and the conjugate the
longest diameter of the figure.</p>

<p>In this book the terms major and minor axis will
be used to designate the dimensions.</p>

<p>The minor and major axes are at a right angle one
to the other, and their point of intersection is termed
the axis of the ellipse.</p>

<p>In an ellipse there are two points situated upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[64]</span>
line representing the major axis, and which are termed
the foci when both are spoken of, and a focus when
one only is referred to, foci simply being the plural
of focus. These foci are equidistant from the centre
of the ellipse, which is formed as follows: Two pins
are driven in on the major axis to represent the foci A
and B, Figure 75, and around these pins a loop of
fine twine is passed; a pencil point, C, is then placed
in the loop and pulled outwards, to take up the slack
of the twine. The pencil is held vertical and moved
around, tracing an ellipse as shown.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 140px;">
<a name="Fig_75" id="Fig_75"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0063-1.jpg" width="140" height="115" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 75.</span>
</div>

<p>Now it is obvious, from this method of construction,
that there will be at every point in the pencil's path a
length of twine from the final point to each of the foci,
and a length from one foci to the other, and the length
of twine in the loop remaining constant, it is demonstrated
that if in a true ellipse we take any number
of points in its curve, and for each point add together
its distance to each focus, and to this add the distance
apart of the foci, the total sum obtained will be the
same for each point taken.<span class='pagenum'>[65]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 140px;">
<a name="Fig_76" id="Fig_76"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0064-1.jpg" width="140" height="147" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 76.</span>

<div class="figright" style="width: 128px;">
<a name="Fig_77" id="Fig_77"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0064-2.jpg" width="128" height="148" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 77.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figures 76 and 77 are a series of ellipses marked
with pins and a piece of twine, as already described.
The corresponding ellipses, as A in both figures, were
marked with the same loop, the difference in the two
forms being due to the difference in distance apart of
the foci. Again, the same loop was used for ellipses
B in both figures, as also for C and D. From these
figures we perceive that&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. With a given width or distance apart of foci,
the larger the dimensions are the nearer the form of
the figure will approach to that of a circle.</p>

<p>2d. The nearer the foci are together in an ellipse,
having any given dimensions, the nearer the form of
the figure will approach that of a circle.</p>

<p>3d. That the proportion of length to width in an
ellipse is determined by the distance apart of the foci.</p>

<p>4th. That the area enclosed within an ellipse of a
given circumference is greater in proportion as the
distance apart of the foci is diminished; and,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>5th. That an ellipse may be given any required
proportion of width to length by locating the foci at
the requisite distance apart.</p>

<p>The form of a true ellipse may be very nearly approached
by means of the arcs of circles, if the centres
from which those arcs are struck are located in the
most desirable positions for the form of ellipse to be
drawn.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 141px;">
<a name="Fig_78" id="Fig_78"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0065-1.jpg" width="141" height="169" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 78.</span>
</div>

<p>Thus in Figure 78 are three ellipses whose forms
were pencilled in by means of pins and a loop of twine,
as already described, but which were inked in by finding
four arcs of circles of a radius that would most
closely approach the pencilled line; <i>a b</i> are the foci
of all three ellipses A, B, and C; the centre for the
end curves of <i>a</i> are at <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>, and those for its side
arcs are at <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>. For B the end centres are at <i>g</i>
and <i>h</i>, and the side centres at <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>. For C the end
centres are at <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, and the side centres at <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[67]</span>
It will be noted that, first, all the centres for the end
curves fall on the line of the length or major axis,
while all those for the sides fall on the line of width
or the minor axis; and, second, that as the dimensions
of the ellipses increase, the centres for the arcs fall
nearer to the axis of the ellipse. Now in proportion
as a greater number of arcs of circles are employed
to form the figure, the nearer it will approach the
form of a true ellipse; but in practice it is not usual
to employ more than eight, while it is obvious that
not less than four can be used. When four are used
they will always fall somewhere on the lines on the
major and minor axis; but if eight are used, two will
fall on the line of the major axis, two on the line of
the minor axis, and the remaining four elsewhere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
<a name="Fig_79" id="Fig_79"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0066-1.jpg" width="165" height="175" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 79.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 79 is a construction wherein four arcs are
used. Draw the line <i>a b</i>, the major axis, and at a
<span class='pagenum'>[68]</span>
right angle to it the line <i>c d</i>, the minor axis of the
figure. Now find the difference between the length
of half the two axes as shown below the figure, the
length of line <i>f</i> (from <i>g</i> to <i>i</i>) representing half the
length of the figure (as from <i>a</i> to <i>e</i>), and the length
or radius from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i> equalling that from <i>e</i> to <i>d</i>;
hence from <i>h</i> to <i>i</i> is the difference between half the
major and half the minor axis. With the radius (<i>h i</i>),
mark from <i>e</i> as a centre the arcs <i>j k</i>, and join <i>j k</i> by
line <i>l</i>. Take half the length of line <i>l</i> and from <i>j</i> as a
centre mark a line on <i>a</i> to the arc <i>m</i>. Now the radius
of <i>m</i> from <i>e</i> will be the radius of all the centres from
which to draw the figure; hence we may draw in the
circle <i>m</i> and draw line <i>s</i>, cutting the circle. Then draw
line <i>o</i>, passing through <i>m</i>, and giving the centre <i>p</i>.
From <i>p</i> we draw the line <i>q</i>, cutting the intersection of
the circle with line <i>a</i> and giving the centre <i>r</i>. From
<i>r</i> we draw line <i>s</i>, meeting the circle and the line <i>c, d</i>,
giving us the centre <i>t</i>. From <i>t</i> we draw line <i>u</i>, passing
through the centre <i>m</i>. These four lines <i>o</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>u</i>
are prolonged past the centres, because they define
what part of the curve is to be drawn from each
centre: thus from centre <i>m</i> the curve from <i>v</i> to <i>w</i> is
drawn, from centre <i>t</i> the curve from <i>w</i> to <i>x</i> is drawn.
From centre <i>r</i> the curve from <i>x</i> to <i>y</i> is drawn, and
from centre <i>p</i> the curve from <i>y</i> to <i>v</i> is drawn. It is
to be noted, however, that after the point <i>m</i> is found,
the remaining lines may be drawn very quickly, because
the line <i>o</i> from <i>m</i> to <i>p</i> may be drawn with the
triangle of 45 degrees resting on the square blade.
The triangle may be turned over, set to point <i>p</i> and
line <i>q</i> drawn, and by turning the triangle again the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[69]</span>
line <i>s</i> may be drawn from point <i>r</i>; finally the triangle
may be again turned over and line <i>u</i> drawn, which
renders the drawing of the circle <i>m</i> unnecessary.</p>

<p>To draw an elliptical figure whose proportion of
width to breadth shall remain the same, whatever the
length of the major axis may be: Take any square
figure and bisect it by the line A in Figure 80. Draw,
in each half of the square, the diagonals E F, G H.
From P as a centre with the radius P R draw the
arc S E R. With the same radius draw from O as
a centre the arc T D V. With radius L C draw
arc R C V, and from K as a centre draw arc S B T.</p>

<p>A very near approach to the true form of a true
ellipse may be drawn by the construction given in
Figure 81, in which A A and B B are centre lines
passing through the major and minor axis of the
ellipse, of which <i>a</i> is the axis or centre, <i>b c</i> is the major
axis, and <i>a e</i> half the minor axis. Draw the rectangle
<i>b f g c</i>, and then the diagonal line <i>b e</i>; at a right angle
to <i>b e</i> draw line <i>f h</i>, cutting B B at <i>i</i>. With radius <i>a e</i>
and from <i>a</i> as a centre draw the dotted arc <i>e j</i>, giving
<span class='pagenum'>[70]</span>
the point <i>j</i> on line B B. From centre <i>k</i>, which is on
the line B B and central between <i>b</i> and <i>j</i>, draw the
semicircle <i>b m j</i>, cutting A A at <i>l</i>. Draw the radius
of the semicircle <i>b m j</i>, cutting it at <i>m</i>, and cutting <i>f g</i>
at <i>n</i>. With the radius <i>m n</i> mark on A A at and from
<i>a</i> as a centre the point <i>o</i>. With radius <i>h o</i> and from
<span class='pagenum'>[71]</span>
centre <i>h</i> draw the arc <i>p o q</i>. With radius <i>a l</i> and from
<i>b</i> and <i>c</i> as centres, draw arcs cutting <i>p o q</i> at the points
<i>p q</i>. Draw the lines <i>h p r</i> and <i>h q s</i> and also the lines
<i>p i t</i> and <i>q v w</i>. From <i>h</i> as a centre draw that part
of the ellipse lying between <i>r</i> and <i>s</i>, with radius <i>p r</i>;
from <i>p</i> as a centre draw that part of the ellipse lying
between <i>r</i> and <i>t</i>, with radius <i>q s</i>, and from <i>q</i> as a centre
draw the ellipse from <i>s</i> to <i>w</i>, with radius <i>i t</i>; and from <i>i</i>
as a centre draw the ellipse from <i>t</i> to <i>b</i> and with radius
<i>v w</i>, and from <i>v</i> as a centre draw the ellipse from <i>w</i>
to <i>c</i>, and one-half of the ellipse will be drawn. It will
be seen that the whole construction has been performed
to find the centres <i>h</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>i</i> and <i>v</i>, and that while
<i>v</i> and <i>i</i> may be used to carry the curve around on the
other side of the ellipse, new centres must be provided
for <i>h</i> <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>, these new centres corresponding
in position to <i>h</i> <i>p</i> <i>q</i>. Divesting the drawing of all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[72]</span>
lines except those determining its dimensions and the
centres from which the ellipse is struck, we have in
Figure 82 the same ellipse drawn half as large. The
centres <i>v</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>h</i> correspond to the same centres in Figure
81, while <i>v'</i>, <i>p'</i>, <i>q'</i>, <i>h'</i> are in corresponding positions
to draw in the other half of the ellipse. The length of
curve drawn from each centre is denoted by the dotted
lines radiating from that centre; thus, from <i>h</i> the part
from <i>r</i> to <i>s</i> is drawn; from <i>h'</i> that part from <i>r'</i> to <i>s'</i>. At
the ends the respective centres <i>v</i> are used for the parts
from <i>w</i> to <i>w'</i> and from <i>t</i> to <i>t'</i> respectively.</p>

<p>The most correct method of drawing an ellipse is
by means of an instrument termed a trammel, which is
shown in Figure 83. It consists of a cross frame in
which are two grooves, represented by the broad black
lines, one of which is at a right angle to the other.
In these grooves are closely fitted two sliding blocks,
carrying pivots E F, which may be fastened to the
sliding blocks, while leaving them free to slide in the
grooves at any adjusted distance apart. These blocks
carry an arm or rod having a tracing point (as pen or
pencil) at G. When this arm is swept around by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[73]</span>
operator, the blocks slide in the grooves and the pen-point
describes an ellipse whose proportion of width
to length is determined by the distance apart of the
sliding blocks, and whose dimensions are determined
by the distance of the pen-point from the sliding block.
To set the instrument, draw lines representing the
major and minor axes of the required ellipse, and set
off on these lines (equidistant from their intersection),
to mark the required length and width of ellipse.
Place the trammel so that the centre of its slots is
directly over the point or centre from which the axes
are marked (which may be done by setting the centres
of the slots true to the lines passing through the axis)
and set the pivots as follows: Place the pencil-point
G so that it coincides with one of the points as C, and
place the pivot E so that it comes directly at the point
of intersection of the two slots, and fasten it there.
Then turn the arm so that the pencil-point G coincides
with one of the points of the minor axis as D, the arm
lying parallel to B D, and place the pivot F over the
centre of the trammel and fasten it there, and the
setting is complete.</p>

<p>To draw a parabola mechanically: In Figure 84
C D is the width and H J the height of the curve.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[74]</span>
Bisect H D in K. Draw the diagonal line J K and
draw K E, cutting K at a right angle to J K, and produce
it in E. With the radius H E, and from J as a
centre, mark point F, which will be the focus of the
curve. At any convenient distance above J fasten a
straight-edge A B, setting it parallel to the base C D
of the parabola. Place a square S with its back
against the straight-edge, setting the edge O N coincident
with the line J H. Place a pin in the focus F, and
tie to it one end of a piece of twine. Place a tracing-point
at J, pass the twine around the tracing-point, bringing
down along the square-blade and fasten it at N, with
the tracing-point kept against the edge of the square
and the twine kept taut; slide the square along the
straight-edge, and the tracing-point will mark the half
J C of the parabola. Turn the square over and
repeat the operation to trace the other half J D.
This method corresponds to the method of drawing
an ellipse by the twine and pins, as already described.</p>

<p>To draw a parabola by lines: Bisect the width A B
in Figure 85, and divide each half into any convenient
number of equal divisions; and through these points
of division draw vertical lines, as 1, 2, 3, etc. (in each
half). Divide the height A D at one end and B E at
the other into as many equal divisions as the half of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[75]</span>
A B is divided into. From the points of divisions 1,
2, 3, etc., on lines A D and B E, draw lines pointing to
C, and where these lines intersect the corresponding
vertical lines are points through which the curve may
be drawn. Thus on the side A D of the curve, the
intersection of the two lines marked 1 is a point in the
curve; the intersection of the two lines marked 2 is
another point in the curve, and so on.</p>

and divide its circumference into twice as many equal
divisions as the line A B was divided into. Draw
radial lines from each point of division on the circle,
and the points of intersection of the radial lines with
the circles are points for the outline of the cam, and
<span class='pagenum'>[76]</span>
through these points a curved line may be drawn giving
the shape of the cam. It is obvious that the
greater the number of divisions on A B, the more
points and the more perfect the curve may be
drawn.</p>

<h3><i>SHADOW LINES AND LINE SHADING.</i></h3>

<h4>SECTION LINING OR CROSS-HATCHING.</h4>


<p>When the interior of a piece is to be shown as a
piece cut in half, or when a piece is broken away, as is
done to make more of the parts show, or show more
clearly, the surface so broken away or cut off is section-lined
or cross-hatched; that is to say, diagonal
lines are drawn across it, and to distinguish one piece
from another these lines are drawn at varying angles
and of varying widths apart. In Figure 87 is given a
view of three cylindrical pieces. It may be known to
be a sectional view by the cross-hatching or section
lines. It would be a difficult matter to represent the
three pieces put together without showing them in
section, because, in an outline view, the collars and recesses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[78]</span>
would not appear. Each piece could of course
be drawn separately, but this would not show how they
were placed when put together. They could be shown
in one view if they were shaded by lines and a piece
shown broken out where the collars and, recesses are,
but line shading is too tedious for detail drawings,
beside involving too much labor in their production.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 87.</span>
</div>

<p>Figure 88 represents a case in which there are
three cylindrical pieces one within the other, the two
inner ones being fastened together by a screw which
is shown dotted in in the end view, and whose position
along the pieces is shown in the side view. The
edges of the fracture in the outer piece are in this case
cross-hatched, to show the line of fracture.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 143px;">
<a name="Fig_88" id="Fig_88"></a>

<img src="images/drawing-0077-2.jpg" width="58" height="105" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 89.</span>
</div>

<p>In cross-hatching it is better that the diagonal lines
do not quite meet the edges of the piece, than that
they should in the least overrun, as is shown in Figure
89, where in the top half the diagonals slightly
overrun, while in the lower half they do not quite
meet the outlines of the piece.</p>

<p>In Figure 90 are shown in section a number of
pieces one within the other, the central bore being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[79]</span>
filled with short plugs. All the cross-hatching was
done with the triangle of 60 degrees and that of 90
degrees. It is here shown that with these two triangles
only, and a judicious arrangement of the diagonals,
an almost infinite number of pieces may be
shown in cross section without any liability of mistaking
one for the other, or any doubt as to the form and
arrangement of the pieces; for, beside the difference
in spacing in the cross-hatching, there are no two adjoining
pieces with the diagonals running in the same
direction. It will be seen that the narrow pieces are
most clearly defined by a close spacing of the cross-hatching.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 106px;">
<a name="Fig_90" id="Fig_90"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0078-1.jpg" width="106" height="130" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 90.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 91 are shown three pieces put together
and having slots or keyways through them. The
outer shell is shown to be in one piece from end to
end, because the cross-hatching is not only equally
spaced, but the diagonals are in the same direction;
hence it would be known that D, F, H, and E were
slots or recesses through the piece. The same remarks
apply to piece B, wherein G, J, K are recesses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[80]</span>
or slots. Piece C is shown to have in its bore a recess
at L. In the case of B, as of A, there would be no
question as to the piece being all one from end to
end, notwithstanding that the two ends are completely
severed where the slots G, I, come, because the
spacing and direction of the cross-hatching are equal
on each side of the slots, which they would not be if
they were separate pieces.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 92.</span>
</div>

<p>Section shading or cross-hatching may sometimes
cause the lines of the drawing to appear crooked to
the eye. Thus, in Figure 92, the key edge on the
right appears curved inwards, while on the left
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[81]</span>
the key edge appears curved outwards, although such
is not actually the case. The same effect is produced
in Figure 93 on the right-hand edge of the key, but
not on the left-hand edge.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 117px;">
<a name="Fig_93" id="Fig_93"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 94.</span>
</div>

<p>A remarkable instance of this kind is shown in
Figure 94, when the vertical lines appear to the eye
to be at a considerable angle one to the other, although
they are parallel.</p>

<p>The lines in sectional shading or cross-hatching
may be made to denote the material of which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[82]</span>
piece is to be composed. Thus Professor Unwin has
proposed the system shown in the Figures 95 and 96.
This may be of service in some cases, but it would
involve very much more labor than it is worth in
ordinary machine shop drawings, except in the case
of cast iron and wood, these two being shown in the
simplest and the usual manner. It is much better to
write the name of the material beneath the piece in a
detail drawing.</p>

<p>LINE SHADING.</p>

<p>Mechanical drawings are made to look better and
to show more distinctly by being line shaded or
shaded by lines. The simplest form of line shading
is by the use of the shade or shadow line.</p>

<p>In a mechanical drawing the light is supposed, for
the purposes of line shading or of coloring, to come
in from the upper left-hand corner of the drawing
paper; hence it falls directly upon the upper and left-hand
lines of each piece, which are therefore represented
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[83]</span>
by fine lines, while the right hand and lower
edges of the piece being on the shadow side may
therefore, with propriety, be represented by broader
lines, which are called shadow or shade lines. These
lines will often serve to indicate the shape of some
part of the piece represented, as will be seen from the
following examples. In Figure 97 is a piece that
contains a hole, the fact being shown by the circle
being thickened at A. If the circle were thickened on
the other side as at B, in Figure 98, it would show
that it represented a cylindrical stem instead of a hole.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 95px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 99.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 99 is represented a washer, the surfaces
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[84]</span>
that are in the shadow side being shown in a shade
line or shadow line, as it is often called.</p>

<p>In Figure 100 is a key drawn with a shade line,
while in Figure 101 the shade line is shown applied
to a nut. The shade line may be produced in straight
lines by drawing the line twice over, and slightly inclining
the pen, or by opening the pen points a little.
For circles, however, it may be produced either by
slightly moving the centre from which the circle is
drawn, or by going over the shade part twice, and
slightly pressing the instrument as it moves, so as to
gradually spring the legs farther apart, the latter plan
being generally preferable.</p>

<p>Figure 102 shows a German pen, that can be regulated
to draw lines of various breadths. The head of
the adjusting screw is made rather larger than usual,
and is divided at the under side into twenty divisional
notches, each alternate notch being marked by a figure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[85]</span>
on the face. By this arrangement a uniform thickness
of line may be maintained after filling or clearing the
pen, and any desired thickness may be repeated, without
any loss of time in trial of thickness on the paper.
A small spring automatically holds the divided screw-head
in any place. With very little practice the click
of the spring in the notches becomes a sufficient guide
for adjustment, without reference to the figures on the
screw-head. Another meritorious feature of this pen
is that it is armed with sapphire points, which retain
their sharpness very long, and thus save the time and
labor required to keep ordinary instruments in order
for the performance of fine work.</p>

<p>An example of line shading in perspective drawing
is shown in the drawing of a pipe threading stock and
die in Figure 103.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 178px;">

</div>

<p>Shading by means of lines may be used with excellent
effect in mechanical drawing, not only to distinguish
round from flat surfaces, but also to denote to
the eye the relative distances of surfaces. Figure 104
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[86]</span>
represents a cylindrical pin line shaded. As the light
is supposed to come in from the upper left-hand corner,
it will evidently fall more upon the left-hand half of
the stem, and of the collar or bead, hence those parts
are shaded with lighter or finer lines than the right-hand
sides are.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">

</div>

<p>Two cylindrical pieces that join each other may be
line shaded at whatever angle they may join. Figure
105 represents two such pieces, one at a right angle
to the other, both being of equal diameter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 237px;">
<a name="Fig_106" id="Fig_106"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 106.</span>
</div>

<p>Figure 106 represents a drawing of a lathe centre
shaded by lines, the lines on the taper parts meeting
those on the parallel part A, and becoming more
nearly parallel to the axis of the piece as the centre
of the piece is approached. The same is the case
where a piece having a curved outline is drawn, which
is shown in Figure 107, where the set of the bow-pen
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[87]</span>
is gradually increased for drawing the shade lines of
the curves. The centres of the shade curves fall in
each case upon a line at a right angle to the axis of
the piece, as upon the lines A, B, C, the dotted lines
showing the radius for each curve.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 165px;">
<a name="Fig_107" id="Fig_107"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0086-1.jpg" width="165" height="212" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 107.</span>
</div>

<p>The lines are made finer by closing the pen points
by means of the screw provided for that purpose.
The pen requires for this purpose to be cleaned of
the ink that is apt to dry in it.</p>

<p>In Figure 108 line shading is shown applied to a ball or sphere, while
in Figure 109 it is shown applied to a pin in a socket which is shown in
section. By showing the hollow in connection with the round piece, the
difference between the two is quite clearly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[88]</span> seen, the light
falling most upon the upper half of the pin and the lower half of the
hole. This perhaps is more clearly shown in the piece of tube in Figure
110, where the thickness of the tube showing is a great aid to the eye.
So, likewise, the hollow or hole is more clearly seen where the piece is
shown in section, as in Figure 111, which is the case even though the
piece be taper as in the figure. If the body be bell-mouthed, as in
Figure 112, the hollow curve is readily shown by the shading; but to
line shade a hollow curve without any of these aids to the eye, as say,
to show a half of a tin tube, is a very difficult
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[89]</span> matter if the
piece is to look natural; and all that can be done is to shade the top
darkly and let the light fall mostly at and near the bottom. An example
of line shading to denote the relative distances from the eye of various
surfaces is given in Figure 113, where the surfaces most distant are the
most shaded. The flat surfaces are lined with lines of equal breadth,
the degrees of shading being governed by the width apart of the lines.</p>

<h3><i>MARKING DIMENSIONS.</i></h3>


<p>The dimensions of mechanical drawings are best
marked in red ink so that they will show plainly, and
that the lines denoting the points at which the dimension
is given shall not be confounded with the lines
of the drawing.</p>

<p>The dimension figures should be as large as the
drawing will conveniently admit; and should be marked
at every point at which a shoulder or change of form
or dimension occurs, except in the case of straight
tapers which have their dimensions marked at each
end of the taper.</p>

<p>In the case of a single piece
standing by itself the dimension
figures may be marked all standing
one way, so as to be read
without changing the position of
the operator or requiring to turn
the drawing around. This is
done in Figure 115, which represents
the drawing of a key. The
figures are here placed outside
the drawing in all cases where it
can be done, which, in the case
of a small drawing, leaves the
same clearer.</p>

</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>In Figure 116 the dimensions are marked, running
parallel to the dimension for which they are given, so
that all measures of length stand lengthwise, and those
of breadth across the drawing.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 154px;">

<p>Figure 117 represents a key with a sharp-cornered
step in it. Here the two dimensions forming the
steps cannot both be coincident with it; hence they
are marked as near to it as convenient, it being understood
that they apply to the step, and not to one
side of it. When the step has a round instead of a
sharp corner, the radius of the arc of the corner may
be marked, as shown in Figure 118.</p>

<p>Figure 119 represents a key drawn in perspective,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[93]</span>
so that all the dimensions may be marked on one
view. Perspective sketches may be used for single
pieces, as they denote the shape of the piece more
clearly to the eye. On account of the skill required
in their production, they are not, however, used in
mechanical drawing, except as in the case of Patent-Office
or similar drawings, where the form and construction
rather than the dimension is the information
sought to be conveyed.</p>

<h3><i>THE ARRANGEMENT OF DIFFERENT VIEWS.</i></h3>

<h3>THE DIFFERENT VIEWS OF A MECHANICAL DRAWING.</h3>


<p>The word <i>elevation</i>, as applied to mechanical drawing,
means simply a view; hence a side elevation is a
side view, or an end elevation is an end view.</p>

<p>The word <i>plan</i> is employed in place of the word
top; hence a plan view is a top view, or a view looking
down upon the top of the piece.</p>

<p>A <i>general</i> view means a view showing the machine
put together or assembled, while a detail drawing is
one containing a detail, as a part of the machine or a
single piece disconnected from the other parts of the
whole machine.</p>

<p>It is obviously desirable in a mechanical drawing to
present the piece of work in as few views as possible,
but in all cases there must be a sufficient number to
permit of the dimensions in every necessary direction
to be marked on the drawing. Suppose, then, that
in Figure 120 we have to represent a solid cylinder,
whose length equals its diameter, and it is obvious
that both the diameter and length may be marked in the
one view given; hence, a second view, such as shown
by the circle in Figure 121, is unnecessary, except it
be to distinguish the body from a cube, in which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[95]</span>
one view would also be sufficient whereon to mark all
the dimensions necessary to enable the piece to be
made. It happens, however, that a cube and a cylinder
are the only two figures upon which all the dimensions
can be marked on one view of the piece,
and as cylindrical pieces are much more common in
machine work than cubes are, it is taken for granted
that, where the pieces are cylindrical, but one view shall
be used, and that where they are cubes either two
views shall be given, or where they are square a cross
shall be marked upon the parts that are square;
thus, in Figure 122, is shown a cross formed by the
lines A B across the face of the drawing, which saves
making a second view.</p>

</div>

<p>It would appear that under some conditions this
might lead to error; as, for example, take the piece in
Figure 123, and there is nothing to denote which is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[96]</span>
the length and which is the diameter of the piece, but
there is a certain amount of custom in such cases than
will usually determine this point; thus, the piece will
be given a name, as pin or disk, the one denoting that
its diameter is less than its length, and the other that
its diameter is greater than its length. In the absence
of any such name, it would be in practice assumed
that it was a pin and not a disk; because, if it were a
disk, it would either be named or shaded, or a second
view given to show its unusual form, the disk being a
more unusual form than the pin-form in mechanical
structures. As an example of the use of the cross to
denote a square, we have Figure 124, which represents
a piece having a hexagon head, section <i>a</i>, <i>a'</i>,
that is rectangular, a collar <i>b</i>, a square part <i>c</i>, and a
round stem <i>d</i>. Here it will be noted that it is the
rectangular part <i>a</i>, <i>a'</i>, that renders necessary two views,
and that in the absence of the cross, yet another view
would be necessary to show that part <i>c</i> is square.</p>

<p>A rectangular piece always requires two views and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[97]</span>
sometimes three. In Figure 125, for example, is a
piece that would require a side view to show the
length and breadth, and an edge view to show the
thickness. Suppose the piece to be wedge-shaped in
any direction; then another view will be necessary, as
is shown in Figs. 126 and 127. In the former the
wedge or taper is in the direction of its length, while
in the latter it is in the direction of its thickness.
Outline views, however, will not in some cases show
the form of the figure, however many views be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[98]</span>
presented. An example of this is given in Figure
128, which represents a ring having a hexagon cross
section. A sectional edge view is here necessary in
order to show the hexagonal form. Another example
of this kind, which occurs more frequently in practice,
is a cupped ring such as shown in Figure 129.</p>

<p>EXAMPLES.</p>

<p>Let it be required to draw a rectangular piece such
as is shown in two views in Figure 130, and the process
for the pencil lines is as follows:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<a name="Fig_131" id="Fig_131"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0098-1.jpg" width="120" height="78" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 131.</span>
</div>

<p>With the bow-pencil set to half the required length
and breadth of the square the arcs 1, 2, 3 and 4, in
Figure 131, are marked, and then the lines 5 and 6,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[99]</span>
letting them run past the width of the arcs 3 and 4.
There is no need to pencil in lines 7 and 8, since they
can be inked in without pencilling, because it is
known that they must meet the arcs 3 and 4 and terminate
at the lines 5 and 6. The top and bottom
lines of the edge view are merely prolongations of
lines 5 and 6; hence the lines 9 and 10 are drawn the
requisite distance apart for the thickness and to meet
the top and bottom lines. The lines are then inked
in, the pencil lines rubbed out, and the drawing will
appear as in Figure 130.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 126px;">
<a name="Fig_132" id="Fig_132"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0098-2.jpg" width="126" height="83" alt=""/>

<img src="images/drawing-0099-1.jpg" width="138" height="91" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 133.</span>
</div>

<p>Suppose, however, that the piece has a step in it, as
in Figure 132, and the pencilling will be as in Figure
133. From the centre, the arcs 1, 2, 3 and 4 for the
outer, and arcs 5, 6, 7 and 8 for the inner square are
marked; lines 9 and 10, and their prolongations, 11
<span class='pagenum'>[100]</span>
and 12, for the edge view, are then pencilled; lines
13 and 14, and their prolongations, 15 and 16, are then
pencilled, and dots to show the locations for lines 21
and 22 maybe marked and the pencilling is complete.
Lines 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 may then be
inked in, in the order named, and then lines 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, when the inking in will be
complete.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 252px;">
<a name="Fig_134" id="Fig_134"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0100-1.jpg" width="252" height="80" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 134.</span>
</div>

<p>In inking in horizontal lines begin at the top and
mark in each line as the square comes to it; and in
inking the vertical ones begin always at the left hand
line and mark the lines as they are come to, moving
the square or the triangle to the right, and great
care should be taken not to let the lines cross where
they meet, as at the corners, since this would greatly
impair the appearance of the drawing.</p>

<p>These figures have been drawn without the aid of
a centre line, because from their shapes it was easy
to dispense with it, but in most cases a centre line is
necessary; thus in Figure 134 we have a body having a
number of steps. The diameters of these steps are
marked by arcs, as in the previous examples, and
their lengths may be marked by applying the measuring
rule direct to the drawing paper and making the
necessary pencil mark.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>But it would be tedious to mark the successive
steps true one with the other by measuring each step,
because one step would require to be pencilled in
before the next could be marked. To avoid this the
centre line 1, Figure 134, is first marked, and the arcs
for the steps are then marked as shown. Centre lines
are also necessary to show the alignment of one part
to another; thus in Figure 135 is a cube with a hole
passing through it. The dotted lines in the side view
show that the hole passes clear through the piece
and is a parallel one, while the centre line, being central
to the outline throughout the piece, shows that
the hole is equidistant, all through, from the walls of
the piece.</p>

</div>

<p>The pencil lines for this piece would be marked as
in Figure 136, line 1 representing the centre line from
which all the arcs are marked. It will be noted that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[102]</span>
the length of the piece is marked by arcs which occur,
because being a cube the set of the compasses for
arcs 2, 3, 4 and 5 will answer without altering to
mark arcs 6 and 7.</p>

</div>

<p>If the hole in the piece were a taper or conical one,
it would be denoted by the dotted lines, as in Figure
137, and that the taper is central to the body is shown
by these dotted lines being equidistant from the centre
line.</p>

<p>Suppose one of the sides to be tapered, as is the
side A, in Figure 138, and that the hole is not central,
and both facts will be shown by the centre lines 1
and 2 in the figure. The measurement of face A
would be marked from A to line B at each end, but
the distance the hole was out of the centre would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[103]</span>
marked by the distance between the centre line 2
and the edge C of the piece.</p>

<p>If the hole did not pass entirely through the piece,
the dotted lines would show it, as in Figure 139.</p>

<p>The designations of the views of a piece of work
depend upon the position in which the piece stands,
<span class='pagenum'>[104]</span>
when in place upon the machine of which it forms
a part. Thus in Figure 140 is a lever, and if its shaft
stood horizontal when the piece is in place in the
machine, the view given is an end one, but suppose
that the shaft stood vertical, and the same view becomes
a plan or top view.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;">
<a name="Fig_142" id="Fig_142"></a>

<img src="images/drawing-0104-1.jpg" width="193" height="152" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 143.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 142 is a view of a lever which is a side
view if the lever stands horizontal, and lever B hangs
down, or a plan view if the shaft stands horizontal,
but lever B stands also horizontal. We may take the
same drawing and turn it around on the paper as in
Figure 143, and it becomes a side view if the shaft
stands vertical, and a plan view if the shaft stands horizontal
and arm D vertical above it.</p>

<p>In a side or an end view, the piece that projects
highest in the drawing is highest when upon the
machine; also in a side elevation the piece that is at
the highest point in the drawing extends farthest
upward when the piece is on the machine. But in
a plan or top view the height of vertical pieces is
not shown, as appears in the case of arm D in Figure
143.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 170px;">
<a name="Fig_144" id="Fig_144"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0105-1.jpg" width="170" height="234" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 144.</span>
</div>

<p>In either of the levers, Figures 142 or 143, all the
dimensions could be marked if an additional view
were given, but this will not be the case if an eye
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[106]</span>
have a slot in it, as at E, in Figure 144, or a jaw have
a tongue in it, as at F: hence, end views of the eye
and the jaw must be given, which may be most conveniently
done by showing them projected from the
ends of those parts as in the figure.</p>

<p>This naturally brings us to a consideration as to
the best method of projecting one view from another.
As a general rule, the side elevation or side view is
the most important, because it shows more of the
parts and details of the work; hence it should be
drawn first, because it affords more assistance in
drawing the other views.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<a name="Fig_145" id="Fig_145"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0106-1.jpg" width="80" height="238" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 145.</span>
</div>

<p>There are two systems of placing the different views
<span class='pagenum'>[107]</span>
of a piece. In the first the views are presented as the
piece would present itself if it were laid upon the paper
for the side view, and then turned or rolled upon the
paper for the other views, as shown in Figure 145,
in which the piece consists of five sections or members,
marked respectively A, B, C, D, and E. Now if
the piece were turned or rolled so that the end face
of B were uppermost, and the member E was beneath,
it will, by the operation of turning it, have assumed
the position in the lower view marked position 2;
while if it were turned over upon the paper in the
opposite direction it would assume the position
marked 3. This gives to the mind a clear idea of
<span class='pagenum'>[108]</span>
the various views and positions; but it possesses some
disadvantages: thus, if position 1 is a side elevation or
view of the piece, as it stands when in place of the
machine, then E is naturally the bottom member; but
it is shown in the top view of the drawing, hence what
is actually the bottom view of the piece (position 3)
becomes the top view in the drawing. A second disadvantage
is that if we desire to put in dotted lines,
to show how one view is derived from the other, and
denote corresponding parts, then these dotted lines
must be drawn across the face of the drawing, making
it less distinct; thus the dotted lines connecting stem
E in position 1 to E in position 3, pass across the faces
of both A and B of position 1.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 88px;">
<a name="Fig_146" id="Fig_146"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0107-1.jpg" width="88" height="201" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 146.</span>
</div>

<p>In a large drawing, or one composed of many members
or parts, it would, therefore, be out of the question
<span class='pagenum'>[109]</span>
to mark in the dotted lines. A further disadvantage
in a large drawing is that it is necessary to go
from one side of the drawing to the other to see the
construction of the same part.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 183px;">
<a name="Fig_147" id="Fig_147"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0108-1.jpg" width="183" height="231" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 147.</span>
</div>

<p>To obviate these difficulties, a modern method is to
suppose the piece, instead of rolling upon the paper,
to be lifted from it, turned around to present the required
view, and then moved upwards on the paper
for a top view, sideways for a side view, and below
for a bottom view. Thus the three views of the piece
in Figure 145 would be as in Figure 146, where position
2 is obtained by supposing the piece to be lifted
from position 1, the bottom face turned uppermost,
and the piece moved down the paper to position 2,
<span class='pagenum'>[110]</span>
which is a bottom view of the piece, and the bottom
view in the drawing. Similarly, if the piece be lifted
from position 1, and the top face in that figure is
turned uppermost, and the piece is then slid upwards
on the paper, view 3 is obtained, being a top view of
the piece as it lies in position 1, and the top view in
the drawing. Now suppose we require to find the
shape of member B, then in Figure 145 we require to
look at the top of position 1, and then down below to
position 2.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 169px;">
<a name="Fig_148" id="Fig_148"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0109-1.jpg" width="169" height="238" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 148.</span>
</div>

<p>But in Figure 146 we have the side view and end
view both together, while the dotted lines do not require
to cross the face of the side view. Now suppose
<span class='pagenum'>[111]</span>
we take a similar piece, and suppose its end
faces, as F, G, to have holes in them, which require to
be shown in both views, and under the one system the
drawing would, if the dotted lines were drawn across,
appear as in Figure 147, whereas under the other
system the drawing would appear as in Figure 148.
And it follows that in cases where it is necessary to
draw dotted lines from one view to the other, it is
best to adopt the new system.

<p>Let it be required to draw a machine screw, and it
is not necessary, and therefore not usual in small
screws to draw the full outline of the thread, but to
represent it by thick and thin lines running diagonally
across the bolt, as in Figure 149, the thick ones representing
the bottom, and the thin ones the top of the
thread. The pencil lines would be drawn in the order
shown in Figure 150. Line 1 is the centre line, and
line 2 a line to represent the lower side of the head;
from the intersection of these two lines as a centre (as
at A) short arcs 3 and 6, showing the diameter of the
thread, are marked, and the arcs 5 and 6, representing
the depth of the thread, are marked. The arc 7, representing
the head, is then marked. The vertical
lines 8, 9, 10, and 11 are then marked, and the outline
of the screw is complete. The thick lines representing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[113]</span>
the bottom of the thread are next marked in,
as in Figure 151, extending from line 9 to line 10.
Midway between these lines fine ones are made for
the tops of the thread. All the lines being pencilled
in, they may be inked in with the drawing instruments,
taking care that they do not overrun one another.
When the pencil lines are rubbed out, the sketch will
appear as in Figure 149.</p>

<p>For a bolt with a hexagon head the lines would be
drawn in the order shown in Figure 152. At a right-angle
to centre line 1, line two is drawn. The pencil-compasses
are then set to half the diameter of the
bolt, and from point A arcs 3 and 6 are pencilled, thus
showing the width of the front flat of the head, as well
as the diameter of the stem. From the point where
these arcs meet line 2, and with the same radius, arcs
5 and 6 are marked, showing the widths of the other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[114]</span>
two flats of the head. The thickness of the head and
the length of the bolt head may then be marked either
by placing a rule on line 1 and marking the short lines
(such as line 7) a cross line 1, or the pencil-compasses
may be set to the rule and the lengths marked from
point A. In the United States standard for bolt heads
and nuts the thickness of the head is made equal to
the diameter of the bolt. With the compasses set for
the arcs 3 and 4, we may in two steps, from A along
the centre line, mark off the thickness of the head
<span class='pagenum'>[115]</span>
without using the rule. But as the rule has to be
applied along line 1 to mark line 7 for the length of
the bolt, it is just as easy to mark the head thickness
at the same time. The line 8 showing the length of
the thread may be marked at the same time as the
other lengths are marked, and the outlines 9, 10, 11,
12, 13 may be drawn in the order named. We have
now to mark the arcs at the top of the flats of the
head to show the chamfer, and to explain how these
arcs are obtained we have in Figure 153 an enlarged
view of the head. It is evident that the smallest
diameter of the chamfer is represented by the circle A,
and therefore the length of the line B must equal A.
It is also evident that the outer edge of the chamfer will
meet the corners at an equal depth (from the face of the
nut), as represented by the line C C, and it is obvious that
the curves that represent the outline of the chamfer
on each side of the head or nut will approach the face
of the head or nut at an equal distance, as denoted
by the line D D. It follows that the curve must in
each case be such as will, at each of its ends, meet the
line C, and at its centre meet the line D D, the centres
of the respective curves being marked in the figure
by X.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently accurate, therefore, for all practical
purposes to set the pencil on the centre-line at the
point A in Figure 152 and mark the curve 14, and to
then set the compasses by trial to mark the other
two curves of the chamfer, so that they shall be an
equal distance with arc 14 from line 9, and join lines
10 and 13 at the same distance from line 9 that 14 joins
lines 3 and 4, so that as in Figure 153 all three of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[116]</span>
the arcs would touch a line as C, and another line
as D.</p>

<p>The basis of the Franklin Institute or United States
standard for the heads of bolts and for nuts is as follows:</p>

<p>The short diameter or width across the flats is equal
to one and one-half times the diameter plus 1/8 inch
for rough or unfinished bolts and nuts, and one and
one-half times the bolt diameter plus, 1/16 inch for finished
heads and nuts. The thickness is, for rough
heads and nuts, equal to the diameter of the bolt,
and for finished heads and nuts 1/16 inch less.</p>

<p>The hexagonal or hexagon (as they are termed in
the shop) heads of bolts may be presented in two
ways, as is shown in Figures 155 and 156.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[119]</span></p>

<p>The latter is preferable, inasmuch as it shows the
width across the flats, which is the dimension that is
worked to, because it is where the wrench fits, and
therefore of most importance; whereas the latter gives
the length of a flat, which is not worked to, except
incidentally, as it were. There is the objection to the
view of the head, given in Figure 156, however, that
unless it is accompanied by an end view it somewhat
resembles a similar view of a square head for a bolt.
It may be distinguished therefrom, however, in the
following points:</p>

<p>If the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the
chamfer circle (as circle A, in Figure 153) of smaller
diameter than the width across the flats of the bolt-head,
the outline of the sides of the head will pass
above the arcs at the top of the flats, and there will
be two small flat places, as A and B, in Figure 156
(representing the angle of the chamfer), which will
not meet the arcs at the top of the flats, but will join
the sides above those arcs, as in the figure; which is
also the case in a similar view of a square-headed
bolt. It may be distinguished therefrom, however,
in the following points:</p>

<p>If the amount of chamfer is such as to leave the
chamfer circle (A, Figure 153) of smaller diameter
than the width across the flats of the bolt-head, the
outline of the sides will pass above the arc on the
flats, as is shown in Figure 157, in which the chamfer
A meets the side of the head at B, and does not,
therefore, meet the arc C. The length of side lying
between B and D in the side view corresponds with
the part lying between E and F in the end view.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">
<a name="Fig_157" id="Fig_157"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0119-1.jpg" width="201" height="276" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 157.</span>
</div>

<p>If we compare this head with similar views of a
square head G, both being of equal widths, and having
their chamfer circles at an equal distance from the
sides of the flats, and at the same angle, we perceive
at once that the amount of chamfer necessary to give
the same distance between the chamfer circle and the
side of the bolt (that is, the distance from J to K,
being equal to that from L to M), the length of the
chamfer N for the square head so greatly exceeds the
length A for the hexagon head that the eye detects
<span class='pagenum'>[121]</span>
the difference at once, and is instinctively informed
that G must be square, independently of the fact
that in the case of the square head, N meets the arc
O, while in the hexagon head, A, which corresponds
to N, does not meet the arc C, which corresponds
to O.</p>

<p>When, however, the chamfer is drawn, but just
sufficient to meet the flats, as in the case of the
hexagon H, and the square I, in Figure 157, the
chamfer line passes from the chamfer circle to the
side of the head, and the distinction is greater, as will
be seen by comparing head H with head I, both being
of equal width, having the same angle of chamfer, and
an amount just sufficient to meet the sides of the flats.
Here it will be seen that in the hexagon H, each side
of the head, as P, meets the chamfer circle A.
Whereas, in the square head these two lines are
joined by the chamfer line Q, the figures being quite
dissimilar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 176px;">
<a name="Fig_158" id="Fig_158"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0120-1.jpg" width="176" height="139" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 158.</span>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that whatever the degree or angle of
the chamfer may be, the diameter of the chamfer
<span class='pagenum'>[122]</span>
circle will be the same in any view in which the head
may be presented. Thus, in Figure 158, the line G
in the side view is in length equal to the diameter of
circle G, in the end view, and so long as the angle
of the chamfer is forty-five degrees, as in all the views
hitherto given, the width of the chamfer will be equal
at corresponding points in the different views; thus
in the figure the widths A and B in the two views
are equal.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 162px;">
<a name="Fig_159" id="Fig_159"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0121-1.jpg" width="162" height="86" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 159.</span>
</div>

<p>If the other view showing a corner of the head in
front of the head be given, the same fact holds good,
as is shown in Figure 159. That the two outside flats
should appear in the drawing to be half the width of the
middle flat is also shown in Figure 158, where D and
E are each half the width of C. Let us now suppose,
that the chamfer be given some other angle than that
of 45 degrees, and we shall find that the effect is to
alter the curves of the chamfer arcs on the flats, as is
shown in Figure 160, where these arcs E, C, D are
shown less curved, because the chamfer B has more
angle to the flats. As a result, the width or distance
between the arcs and line G is different in the
two views. On this account it is better to draw the
chamfer at 45 degrees, as correct results may be obtained
with the least trouble.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>If no chamfer at all is to be given, a hexagon
head may still be distinguished from a square one,
providing that the view giving three sides of the head,
as in Figure 158, is shown, because the two sides D
and E being half the width of the middle one C, imparts
the information that it is a hexagon head. If, however,
the view showing but two of the sides and a
corner in front is given, and no chamfer is used, it
could not be known whether the head was to be hexagon
or square, unless an end view be given, as in
Figure 161.</p>

<p>If the view showing a full side of the head of a
square-headed bolt is given, then either an end view
must be given, as in Figure 162, or else a single view
with a cross on its head, as in Figure 163, may be
given.</p>

<p>It is the better plan, both in square and hexagon
heads, to give the view in which the full face of a flat
is presented, that is, as in Figures 155 and 163; because,
in the case of the square, the length of a side
and the width across the head are both given in that
view; whereas if two sides are shown, as in Figure
161, the width across flats is not given, and this is the
<span class='pagenum'>[124]</span>
dimension that is wanted to work to, and not the
width across corners. In the case of a hexagon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[125]</span>
middle of the three flats is equal in width to the diameter
of the bolt, and the other two are one-half its
width; all three, therefore, being marked with the same
set of compasses as gives the diameter of the body of
the bolt, were as shown in Figure 152. For the width
across flats there is an accepted standard; hence
there is no need to mark it upon the drawing, unless
in cases where the standard is to be departed from,
in which event an end view may be added, or the
view showing two sides may be given.</p>

<p>To draw a square-headed bolt, the pencil lines are
marked in the order shown by figures in Figure 164.
The inking in is done in the order of the letters <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
etc. It will be observed that pencil lines 2, 9, and 10
are not drawn to cross, but only to meet the lines at
their ends, a point that, as before stated, should always
be carefully attended to.</p>

<p>To draw the end view of a hexagon head, first draw
a circle of the diameter across the flats, and then rest
<span class='pagenum'>[126]</span>
the triangle of 60 degrees on the blade <i>s</i> of the square,
as at T 1, in Figure 165, and mark the lines <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.
Reverse the triangle, as at T 2, and draw lines <i>c</i> and
<i>d</i>. Then place the triangle as in Figure 166, and
draw the lines <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>If the other view of the head is to be drawn, then
first draw the lines <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in Figure 167 with the
square, then with the 60 degree triangle, placed on
the square S, as at T 1, draw the lines <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and turning
the square over, as at T 2, mark lines <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>If the diameter across corners of a square head is
given, and it be required to draw the head, the process
is as follows: For a view showing one corner in
front, as in Figure 168, a circle of the given diameter
across corners is pencilled, and the horizontal centre-line
<i>a</i> is marked, and the triangle of 45 degrees is
<span class='pagenum'>[127]</span>
rested against the square blade S, as in position T 1,
and lines <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> marked, <i>b</i> being marked first; and
the triangle is then slid along the square blade to position
T 1, when line <i>c</i> is marked, these two lines just
meeting the horizontal line <i>a</i>, where it meets the circle.
The triangle is then moved to the left, and line
<i>d</i>, joining the ends of <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, is marked, and by moving
it still farther to the left to position T 2, line <i>e</i> is
marked. Lines <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and <i>e</i> are, of course, the only
ones inked in.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 169.</span>
</div>

<p>If the flats are to lie in the other direction, the
pencilling will be done as in Figure 169. The circle
is marked as before, and with the triangle placed as
shown at T 1, line <i>a</i>, passing through the centre of
the circle, is drawn. By moving the triangle to the
right its edge B will be brought into position to mark
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[128]</span>
line <i>b</i>, also passing through the centre of the circle.
All that remains is to join the ends of these two lines,
using the square blade for lines <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, and the triangle
for <i>e</i> and <i>f</i>, its position on the square blade being
denoted at T 3; lines <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, are the ones inked in.</p>

<p>For a hexagon head we have the processes, Figures
170 and 171. The circle is struck, and across it line
<i>a</i>, Figure 170, passing through its centre, the triangle
of sixty degrees will mark the sides <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, as
shown, and the square blade is used for <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>The chamfer circles are left out of these figures to
reduce the number of lines and so keep the engraving
clear. Figure 171 shows the method of drawing a
hexagon head when the diameter across corners is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[129]</span>
given, the lines being drawn in the alphabetical order
marked, and the triangle used as will now be understood.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 77px;">
<a name="Fig_172" id="Fig_172"></a>

<span class="caption">Fig. 173.</span>
</div>

<p>It may now be pointed out that the triangle may be
used to divide circles much more quickly than they
could be divided by stepping around them with compasses.
Suppose, for example, that we require to
divide a circle into eight equal parts, and we may do
so as in Figure 172, line <i>a</i> being marked from the
square, and lines <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> from the triangle of forty-five
degrees; the lines to be inked in to form an octagon
need not be pencilled, as their location is clearly
defined, being lines joining the ends of the lines
crossing the circle, as for example, lines <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>Let it be required to draw a polygon having twelve
equal sides, and the triangle of sixty is used,
marking all the lines within the circle in Figure 173,
except <i>a</i>, for which the square blade is used; the only
lines to be inked in are such as <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>. In this example
there is a corner at the top and bottom, but suppose
it were required that a flat should fall there instead
of a corner; then all we have to do is to set the square
<span class='pagenum'>[130]</span>
blade S at the required angle, as in Figure 174, and
then proceed as before, bearing in mind that the point
of the circle nearest to the square blade, straight-edge,
or whatever the triangle is rested on, is always a
corner of a polygon having twelve sides.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 114px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 175.</span>
</div>

<p>In both of these examples we have assumed that
the diameter across corners of the polygon was
given, but suppose the diameter across the flats were
given, and the construction is a little more complicated.
Circle <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, in Figure 175, is drawn of the required
diameter across the flats, and the lines of division are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[131]</span>
drawn across with the triangle of 60 as before; the
triangle of 45 is then used to draw the four lines, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, joining the ends of lines <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, and touching
the inner circle, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>. The outer circle is then pencilled
in, touching the lines of division where they meet the
lines <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, and the rest of the lines for the sides of
the polygon may then be drawn within the outer circle,
as at <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 101px;">
<a name="Fig_176" id="Fig_176"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0130-1.jpg" width="101" height="95" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 176.</span>
</div>

<p>It is obvious, also, that the triangle may be used to
draw slots radiating from a centre, as in Figure 176,
where it is desired to draw a chuck-plate having 6
slots. The triangle of 60 is used to draw the centre
lines, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc., for the slots. From the centre, the
arcs <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, etc., are marked, showing where the
centres will fall for describing the half circles forming
the ends of the slots. Then half circles, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, etc.,
being drawn, the sides of the slots may be drawn in
with the triangle, and the outer circle and the slots
inked in.</p>

<p>If the slots are not to radiate from the centre of
the circle the process is as follows:</p>

<p>The outer circle <i>a</i>, Figure 177, being drawn, an inner
one <i>b</i> is drawn, its radius equalling the amount; the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[132]</span>
centres of the slots are to point to one side of the
centre of circle <i>a</i>. The triangle is then used to
divide the circle into the requisite number of divisions
<i>c</i> for the slots, and arcs <i>i, j</i>, are then drawn for the
lengths of the slots. The centre lines <i>e</i> are then
drawn, passing through the lines <i>c</i>, and the arcs <i>i, j</i>,
etc., and touching the perimeter of the inner circle <i>b</i>;
arcs <i>f, g</i>, are then marked in, and their sides joined
with the triangle adjusted by hand. All that would
be inked in black are the outer circle and the slots, but
the inner circle <i>b</i> and a centre line of one of the
slots should be marked in red ink to show how the
inclination of the slot was obtained, and therefore its
amount.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 177.</span>
</div>

<p>For a five-sided figure it is best to step around the
circumference of the circle with the compasses, but
for a three-sided one, or trigon, the construction is as
follows: It will be found that the compasses set to
the radius of a circle will accurately divide it into six
equal divisions, as is shown in Figure 178; hence
every other one of these divisions will be the location
for a corner of a trigon.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p>The circle being drawn, a line A, 179, is drawn
through its centre, and from its intersection with the
circle as at <i>b</i>, here a step on each side is marked as <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
then lines <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, and <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> to <i>e</i>, where A meets, the
circle will describe a trigon. If the figure is to stand
vertical, all that is necessary is to draw the line <i>a</i>
vertical, as in Figure 180. A ready method of getting
the dimension across corners, across the flats, or the
length of a side of a given polygon, is by means of
diagrams, such as shown in the following figures,
which form excellent examples for practice.</p>

<p>Draw the line O P, Figure 181, and at a right angle
to it the line O B; divide these two lines into parts of
one inch, as shown in the cut, which is divided into
<span class='pagenum'>[134]</span>
inches and quarter inches, and from these points of
division draw lines crossing each other as shown.</p>

angles to the line O P. As shown in the cut, these
diagonal lines are marked:</p>

</table></div>

<p>But still others could be added for figures having a
greater number of sides.</p>

<p>1. Now it will be found as follows: Half the diameter,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[135]</span>
or the radius of a piece of cylindrical work being
given, and the number of sides it is to have being
stated, the length of one side will be the distance
measured horizontally from the line O B to the diagonal
line for that particular number of sides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;A piece of work is 2-1/2 inches in diameter,
and is required to have 9 sides: what will be the
length of the sides or flats?</p>

<p>Now the half diameter or radius of 2-1/2 inches
is 1-1/4 inches. Then look along the line O B for 1-1/4,
which is denoted in the cut by figures and the arrow
A; set one point of the compasses at A, and the
other at the point of crossing of the diagonal line with
the 1-1/4 horizontal line, as shown in the figure at <i>a</i>,
and from A to <i>a</i> is the length of one side.</p>

<p>Again: A piece of work, 4 inches in diameter, is
to have 9 sides: how long will each side be?</p>

<p>Now half of 4 is 2, hence from B to <i>b</i> is the length
of each side.</p>

<p>But suppose that from the length of each side, and
the number of sides, it is required to find the diameter
to which to turn the piece; that is, its diameter across
corners, and we simply reverse the process thus: A
body has 9 sides, each side measures 27/32: what is its
diameter across corners?</p>

<p>Take a rule, apply it horizontally on the figure, and
pass it along till the distance from the line O B to the
diagonal line marked 9 sides measures 27/32, which is
from 1-1/4 on O B to <i>a</i>, and the 1-1/4 is the radius, which,
multiplied by 2, gives 2-1/2 inches, which is the required
diameter across corners.</p>

<p>For any other number of sides the process is just
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[136]</span>
the same. Thus: A body is 3-1/2 inches in diameter,
and is to have 5 sides: what will be the length of each
side? Now half of 3-1/2 is 1-3/4; hence from 1-3/4 on the
line O B to the point C, where the diagonal line crosses
the 1-3/4 line, is the length of each of the sides.</p>

<p>2. It will be found that the length of a side of a
square being given, the size of the square, measured
across corners, will be the length of the diagonal line
marked 45 degrees, from the point O to the figures
indicating, on the line O B or on the line O P, the
length of one side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;A square body measures 1 inch on each
side: what does it measure across the corners? Answer:
From the point O, along diagonal line marked
45 degrees, to the point where it crosses the lines 1
(as denoted in the figure by a dot).</p>

<p>Again: A cylindrical piece of wood requires to be
squared, and each side of the square must measure
an inch: what diameter must the piece be turned to?</p>

<p>Now the diagonal line marked 45 degrees passes
through the 1-inch line on O B, and the inch line on
O P, at the point where these lines meet; hence all we
have to do is to run the eye along either of the lines
marked inch, and from its point of meeting the 45 degrees
line, to the point O, is the diameter to turn the
piece to.</p>

<p>There is another way, however, of getting this same
measurement, which is to set a pair of compasses from
the line 1 on O B, to line 1 on O P, as shown by the
line D, which is the full diameter across corners. This
is apparent, because from point O, along line O B, to
1, thence to the dot, thence down to line 1 on O P, and
<span class='pagenum'>[137]</span>
along that to O, encloses a square, of which either from
O to the dot, or the length of the line D, is the measurement
across corners, while the length of each side,
or diameter across the flats, is from point O to either of
the points 1, or from either of the points 1 to the dot.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 288px;">
<a name="Fig_182" id="Fig_182"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0136-1.jpg" width="288" height="301" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 182.</span>
</div>

<p>After graphically demonstrating the correctness of
the scale we may simplify it considerably. In Figure
182, therefore, we have applications shown. A is a
hexagon, and if one of its sides be measured, it will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[138]</span>
be found that it measures the same as along line 1
from O B to the diagonal line 45 degrees, which distance
is shown by a thickened line.</p>

<p>At 1-1/2 is shown a seven-sided figure, whose diameter
is 3 inches, and radius 1-1/2 inches, and if from the
point at 1-1/2 (along the thickened horizontal line), to
the diagonal marked 49 degrees, be measured, it will
be found exactly equal to the length of a side on the
polygon.</p>

<p>At C is shown part of a nine-sided polygon, of 2-inch
radius, and the length of one of its sides will be
found to equal the distance from the diagonal line
marked 52-1/2 degrees, and the line O B at 2.</p>

<p>Let it now be noted that if from the point O, as a
centre, we describe arcs of circles from the points of
division on O B to O P, one end of each arc will meet
the same figure on O P as it started from at O B, as
is shown in Figure 181, and it becomes apparent that in
the length of diagonal line between O and the required
arc we have the radius of the polygon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Example.</span>&mdash;What is the radius across corners of a
hexagon or six-sided figure, the length of a side being
an inch?</p>

<p>Turning to our scale we find that the place where
there is a horizontal distance of an inch between the
diagonal 45 degrees, answering to six-sided figures, is
along line 1 (Figure 182), and the radius of the circle
enclosing the six-sided body is, therefore, an inch, as
will be seen on referring to circle A. But it will be noted
that the length of diagonal line 45 degrees, enclosed
between the point O and the arc of circle from 1 on
O B to one on O P, measures also an inch. Hence
<span class='pagenum'>[139]</span>
we may measure the radius along the diagonal lines
if we choose. This, however, simply serves to demonstrate
the correctness of the scale, which, being
understood, we may dispense with most of the lines,
arriving at a scale such as shown in Figure 183, in
which the length of the side of the polygon is the distance
from the line O B, measured horizontally to the
diagonal, corresponding to the number of sides of the
polygon. The radius across corners of the polygon
is that of the distance from O along O B to the horizontal
line, giving the length of the side of the polygon,
and the width across corners for a given length
of one side of the square, is measured by the length
of the lines A, B, C, etc. Thus, dotted line 2 shows

<p>The dotted line 2-1/2 shows the length of the side of a

<p>This scale lacks, however, one element, in that the
diameter across the flats of a regular polygon being
given, it will not give the diameter across the corners.
This, however, we may obtain by a somewhat similar
construction. Thus, in Figure 184, draw the line
O B, and divide it into inches and parts of an
<span class='pagenum'>[141]</span>
inch. From these points of division draw horizontal
lines; from the point O draw the following lines and
at the following angles from the horizontal line
O P.</p>

<p>A hexagon measures two inches across the flats:
what is its diameter measured across the corners?
Now from point O to the horizontal line marked 1
inch, measured along the line of 60 degrees, is 1
5-32nds inches: hence the hexagon measures twice
that, or 2 5-16ths inches across corners. The proof
of the construction is shown in the figure, the hexagon
and other polygons being marked simply for

<p>Let it be required to draw the stud shown in Figure
185, and the construction would be, for the pencil
lines, as shown in Figure 186; line 1 is the centre line,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[143]</span>
arcs, 2 and 3 give the large, and arcs 4 and 5 the
small diameter, to touch which lines 6, 7, 8, and 9
may be drawn. Lines 10, 11, and 12 are then drawn
for the lengths, and it remains to draw the curves in.
In drawing these curves great exactitude is required
to properly find their centres; nothing looks worse in
a drawing than an unfair or uneven junction between
curves and straight lines. To find the location for
these centres, set the compasses to the required radius
for the curve, and from the point or corner A draw the
arcs <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, from <i>c</i> mark the arc <i>e</i>, and from <i>b</i> the
arc <i>d</i>, and where <i>d</i> and <i>e</i> cross is the centre for the
curve <i>f</i>.</p>

<p>Similarly for the curve <i>h</i>, set the compasses on <i>i</i>
and mark the arc <i>g</i>, and from the point where it
crosses line 6, draw the curve <i>h</i>. In inking in it is
best to draw in all curves or arcs of circles first, and
the straight lines that join them afterward, because, if
the straight lines are drawn first, it is a difficult matter
to alter the centres of the curves to make them
<span class='pagenum'>[144]</span>
fall true, whereas, after the curves are drawn it is an
easy matter, if it should be necessary, to vary the line
a trifle, so as to make it join the curves correctly and
fair. In inking in these curves also, care must be
taken not to draw them too short or too long, as this
would impair the appearance very much, as is shown
in Figure 187.</p>

<p>To draw the piece shown in Figure 188, the lines
are drawn in the order indicated by the letters in Figure

well for the beginner to draw examples of common
objects, such as the hand hammer in Figure 190, or the
chuck plate in Figure 191, which afford good examples
in the drawing of arcs and circles.

are derived from the top view, while the thickness of
the stem and height of the hubs may be measured
from the line A. In Figure 193 there are hubs (on

all measurements should be marked.</p>

<p>In Figure 196 is an example of a connecting rod
end. From a point, as A, we draw arcs, as B C for
the width, and E D for the length of the block, and
through A we draw the centre line. It is obvious,
however, that we may draw the centre line first, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[148]</span>
apply the measuring rule direct to the paper, and
mark lines in place of the arcs B, C, D, E, and F, G,
which are for the stem. As the block joins the stem
in a straight line, the latter is evidently rectangular,
as will be seen by referring to Figure 197, which represents
a rod end with a round stem, the fact that the
stem is round being clearly shown by the curves A B.
The radius of these curves is obtained as follows: It
is obvious that they will join the rod stem at the same
point as the shoulder curves do, as denoted by the
dotted vertical line. So likewise they join the curves
E F at the same point in the rod length as the shoulder
curves, both curves in fact being formed by the
same round corner or shoulder. The centre of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[149]</span>
radius of A or B must therefore be the same distance
from the centre of the rod as is the centre from which
the shoulder curve is struck, and at the same time at
such a distance from the corner (as E or F) that the
curve will meet the centre line of the rod at the same
point in its length as the shoulder curves do.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 99px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 198.</span>
</div>

<p>Figure 198 gives an example, in which the similar
curved lines show that a part is square. The figure
represents a bolt with a square under the head. As
but one view is given, that fact alone tells us that it
must be round or square. Now we might mark a
cross on the square part, to denote that it is square;
but this is unnecessary, because the curves F G show
such to be the case. These curves are marked as
follows: With the compasses set to the radius E, one
point is rested at A, and arc B is drawn; then one
point of the compass is rested at C, and arc D is
drawn; giving the centre for the curve F by a similar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>[150]</span>
process on the other side of the figure, curve G is
drawn. Point C is obtained by drawing the dotted
line across where the outline curve meets the stem.
Suppose that the corner where the round stem meets
the square under the head was a sharp one instead of
a curve, then the traditional cross would require to be
put on the square, as in Figure 199; or the cross will
be necessary if the corner be a round one, if the stem
is reduced in diameter, as in Figure 200.</p>

<p>Figure 201 represents a centre punch, giving an
example, in which the flat sides gradually run out
upon a circle, the edges forming curves, as at A, B,

<span class='pagenum'>[150]</span>
They must begin where the taper of the punch
joins the parallel, or at C, C, and they must end on
that part of the taper stem where the diameter is
equal to the diameter across the flats of the octagon.
All that is to be done then is to find the diameter
across the flats on the end view, and mark it on the
taper stem, as at D, D, which will show where the
flats terminate on the taper stem. And the curved
lines, as A, B, may be drawn in by a curve that must
meet at the line C, and also in a rounded point at
line D.</p>

<p>The screw thread for small bolts is represented by
thick and thin lines, such as was shown in Figure 152,
but in larger sizes; the angles of the thread also are
drawn in, as in Figure 202, and the method of doing
this is shown in Figure 203. The centre line 1 and
lines 2 and 3 for the full diameter of the thread being
drawn, set the compasses to the required pitch of the
thread, and stepping along line 2, mark the arcs 4,
5, 6, etc., for the full length the thread is to be
marked. With the triangle resting against the <b>T</b>-square,
the lines 7, 8, 9, etc. (for the full length of the
thread), are drawn from the points 4, 5, 6, on line 2.
These give one side of the thread. Reversing the
drawing triangle, angles 10, 11, etc., are then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[152]</span>
drawn, which will complete the outline of the thread
at the top of the bolt. We may now mark the depth
of the thread by drawing line 12, and with the compasses
set on the centre line transfer this depth to the
other side of the bolt, as denoted by the arcs 13 and
14. Touching arc 14 we mark line 15 for the thread
<span class='pagenum'>[153]</span>
depth on that side. We have now to get the slant of
the thread across the bolt. It is obvious that in
passing once around the bolt the thread advances to
the amount of the pitch as from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; hence, in
passing half way around, it will advance from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>;
we therefore draw line 16 at a right-angle to the centre
line, and a line that touches the top of the threads
at <i>a</i>, where it meets line 2, and also meets line 16,
where it touches line 3, is the angle or slope for the
tops of the threads, which may be drawn across by
lines, as 18, 19, 20, etc. From these lines the sides of
the thread may be drawn at the bottom of the bolt,
marking first the angle on one side, as by lines 21, 22,
23, etc., and then the angles on the other, as by lines
24, 25, etc.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 171px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 204.</span>
</div>

<p>There now remain the bottoms of the thread to
draw, and this is done by drawing lines from the bottom
of the thread on one side of the bolt to the bottom
on the other, as shown in the cut by a dotted line;
hence, we may set a square blade to that angle, and
mark in these lines, as 26, 27, 28, etc., and the thread
is pencilled in complete.</p>

<p>If the student will follow out this example upon
<span class='pagenum'>[154]</span>
paper, it will appear to him that after the thread had
been marked out on one side of the bolt, the angle of
the thread might be obtained, as shown by lines 16
and 17, and that the bottoms of the thread as well as
the tops might be carried across the bolt to the other
side. Figure 204 represents a case in which this has
been done, and it will be observed that the lines denoting
the bottom of the thread do not meet the bottoms
of the thread, which occurs for the reason that the
angle for the bottom is not the same as that for the
top of the thread.</p>

<p>In inking in the thread, it enhances the appearance
to give the bottom of the thread and the right-hand
<span class='pagenum'>[155]</span>
side of the same, heavy shade lines, as in Figure 202,
a plan that is usually adopted for threads of large diameter
and coarse pitch.</p>

<p>A double thread, such as in Figure 205, is drawn in
the same way, except that the slant of the thread is
doubled, and the square is to be set for the thread-pitch
A, A, both for the tops and bottoms of the
thread.</p>

<p>A round top and bottom thread, as the Whitworth
thread, is drawn by single lines, as in Figure 206.
A left-hand thread, Figure 207, is obviously drawn by
the same process as a right-hand one, except that the
slant of the thread is given in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>For screw threads of a large diameter it is not uncommon
to draw in the thread curves as they appear
to the eye, and the method of doing this is shown in
Figure 208. The thread is first marked on both sides
of the bolt, as explained, and instead of drawing,
straight across the bolt, lines to represent the tops
and bottoms of the thread, a template to draw the
curves by is required. To get these curves, two half-circles,
one equal in diameter to the top, and one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[156]</span>
equal to the bottom of the thread, are drawn, as in
Figure 208.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 228px;">
<a name="Fig_208" id="Fig_208"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0156-1.jpg" width="228" height="229" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 208.</span>
</div>

<p>These half-circles are divided into any convenient
number of equal divisions: thus in Figure 208, each has
eight divisions, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc., for the outer, and <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>,
etc., for the inner one. The pitch of the thread is
then divided off by vertical lines into as many equal
divisions as the half-circles are divided into, as by
the lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc., to <i>o</i>. Of these, the seven from <i>a</i>,
to <i>h</i>, correspond to the seven from <i>a'</i> to <i>g'</i>, and are
for the top of the thread, and the seven from <i>i</i> to <i>o</i>
correspond to the seven on the inner half-circle, as <i>i</i>,
<i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, etc. Horizontal lines are then drawn from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[157]</span>
points of the division to meet the vertical lines of division;
thus the horizontal dotted line from <i>a'</i> meets
the vertical line <i>a</i>, and where they meet, as at A, a dot
is made. Where the dotted line from <i>b'</i> meets vertical
line <i>b</i>, another dot is made, as at B, and so on
until the point G is found. A curve drawn to pass
from the top of the thread on one side of the bolt to
the top of the other side, and passing through these
points, as from A to G, will be the curve for the top
of the thread, and from this curve a template may be
made to mark all the other thread-tops from, because
manifestly all the tops of the thread on the bolt will
be alike.</p>

<p>For the bottoms of the thread, lines are similarly
drawn, as from <i>i'</i> to meet <i>i</i>, where dot I is marked. J is
got from <i>j'</i> and <i>j</i>, while K is got from the intersection of
<i>k'</i> with <i>k</i>, and so on, the dots from I to O being those
through which a curve is drawn for the bottom of the
thread, and from this curve a template also may be
made to mark all the thread bottoms. We have in
our example used eight points of division in each
half-circle, but either more or less points maybe used,
the only requisite being that the pitch of the thread
must be divided into as many divisions as the two half-circles
are. But it is not absolutely necessary that
both half-circles be divided into the same number of
equal divisions. Thus, suppose the large half-circle
were divided into ten divisions, then instead of the first
half of the pitch being divided into eight (as from <i>a</i>
to <i>h</i>) it would require to have ten lines. But the
inner half-circle may have eight only, as in our example.
It is more convenient, however, to use the
<span class='pagenum'>[158]</span>
same number of divisions for both circles, so that
they may both be divided together by lines radiating
from the centre. The more the points of division, the
greater number of points to draw the curves through;
hence it is desirable to have as many as possible,
which is governed by the pitch of the thread, it being
obvious that the finer the pitch the less the number of
distinct and clear divisions it is practicable to divide
it into. In our example the angles of the thread are
spread out to cause these lines to be thrown further
apart than they would be in a bolt of that diameter;
hence it will be seen that in threads of but two or
three inches in diameter the lines would fall very
close together, and would require to be drawn finely
and with care to keep them distinct.</p>

<p>The curves for a United States standard form of
thread are obtained in the same manner as from the
<b>V</b> thread in Figure 208, but the thread itself is more
difficult to draw. The construction of this thread is
shown in Figure 208, it having a flat place at the top
and at the bottom of the thread. A common <b>V</b> thread
has its sides at an angle of 60 degrees, one to the
other, the top and bottom meeting in a point. The
United States standard is obtained from drawing a
common <b>V</b> thread and dividing its depth into eight
equal divisions, as at <i>x</i>, in Figure 208 <i>a</i>, and cutting
off one of these divisions at the top and filling in one
at the bottom to form flat places, as shown in the figure.
But the thread cannot be sketched on a bolt by this
means unless temporary lines are used to get the
thread from, these temporary lines being drawn to
represent a bolt one-fourth the depth of the thread too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[159]</span>
large in diameter. Thus, in Figure 208 <i>a</i>, it is seen
that cutting off one-eighth the depth of the thread reduces
the diameter of the thread. It is necessary,
then, to draw the flat place on top of the thread first,
the order of procedure being shown in Figure 209.
The lines for the full diameter of the thread being
drawn, the pitch is stepped off by arcs, as 1, 2, 3, etc.;
and from these, arcs, as 4, 5, 6, etc., are marked for
the width of the flat places at the tops of the threads.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[160]</span>
Then one side of the thread is marked off by lines, as
7, which meet the arcs 1, 2, 3, etc., as at <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, etc.
Similar lines, as 8 and 9, are marked for the other
side of the thread, these lines, 7, 8 and 9, projecting
until they cross each other. Line 10 is then drawn,
making a flat place at the bottom of the thread equal
in width to that at the top. Line 12 is then drawn
square across the bolt, starting from the bottom of the
thread, and line 13 is drawn starting from the corner
<i>f</i> on one side of the thread and meeting line 12 on
the other side of the thread, which gives the angle for
the tops of the thread. The depth of the thread may
then be marked on the other side of the bolt by the
arcs <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, and the line 14. The tops of all the
threads may then be drawn in, as by lines 15, 16, 17
and 18, and by lines, as 19, etc., the thread sides may
be drawn on the other side of the bolt. All that remains
is to join the bottoms of the threads by lines
across the bolt, and the pencil lines will be complete,
ready to ink in. If the thread is to be shown curved
instead of drawn straight across, the curve may be
obtained by the construction in Figure 208, which is
similar to that in Figure 207, except that while the
pitch is divided off into 16 divisions, the whole of these
16 divisions are not used to get the curves, some of
them being used twice over; thus for the bottom the
eight divisions from <i>b</i> to <i>i</i> are used, while for the tops
the eight from <i>g</i> to <i>o</i> are used. Hence <i>g</i>, <i>h</i> and <i>i</i> are
used for getting both curves, the divisions from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>
and from <i>o</i> to <i>p</i> being taken up by the flat top and
bottom of the thread. It will be noted that in Figure
207, the top of the thread is drawn first, while in Figure
<span class='pagenum'>[161]</span>
208 the bottom is drawn first, and that in the
latter (for the U.S. standard) the pitch is marked
from centre to centre of the flats of the thread.</p>

<p>To draw a square thread the pencil lines are marked
in the order shown in Figure 210, in which 1 represents
the centre line and 2, 3, 4 and 5, the diameter
and depth of the thread. The pitch of the thread is
marked off by arcs, as 6, 7, etc., or by laying a rule directly
on the centre line and marking with a lead pencil.
To obtain the slant of the thread, lines 8 and 9
are drawn, and from these line 10, touching 8 and 9
where they meet lines 2 and 5; the threads may then
be drawn in from the arcs as 6, 7, etc. The side of
the thread will show at the top and the bottom as at
A B, because of the coarse pitch and the thread on
the other or unseen side of the bolt slants, as denoted
by the lines 12, 13; and hence to draw the sides A B,
the triangle must be set from one thread to the next
on the opposite side of the bolt, as denoted by the
dotted lines 12 and 13.</p>

<p>If the curves of the thread are to be drawn in, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[162]</span>
may be obtained as in Figure 211, which is substantially
the same as described for a V thread. The
curves <i>f</i>, representing the sides of the thread, terminate
at the centre line <i>g</i>, and the curves <i>e</i> are equidistant
with the curves <i>c</i> from the vertical lines <i>d</i>. As
<span class='pagenum'>[163]</span>
the curves <i>f</i> above the line are the same as <i>f</i> below
the line, the template for <i>f</i> need not be made to extend
the whole distance across, but one-half only; as
is shown by the dotted curve <i>g</i>, in the construction for
finding the curve for square-threaded nuts in Figure
212.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 213.</span>
</div>

<p>A specimen of the form of template for drawing
these curves is shown in Figure 213; <i>g</i> <i>g</i>, is the centre
line parallel to the edges R, S; lines <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, represent
the diameter of the thread at the top, and <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>,
that at the bottom or root; edge <i>a</i> is formed to the
points (found by the constructions in the figures as
already explained) for the tops of the thread, and edge
<i>f</i> is so formed for the curve at the thread bottoms.
The edge, as S or R, is laid against the square-blade
to steady it while drawing in the curves. It may be
noted, however, that since the curve is the same below
the centre line as it is above, the template may be made
to serve for one-half the thread diameter, as at <i>f</i>, where
it is made from <i>o</i> to <i>g</i>, only being turned upside down
to draw the other half of the curve; the notches cut
out at <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>, are merely to let the pencil-lines in the
drawing show plainly when setting the template.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<p>When the thread of a nut is shown in section, it
slants in the opposite direction to that which appears
on the bolt-thread, because it shows the thread that
fits to the opposite side of the bolt, which, therefore,
slants in the opposite direction, as shown by the lines
12 and 13 in Figure 210.</p>

<p>In a top or end view of a nut the thread depth is
usually shown by a simple circle, as in Figure 214.</p>

<p>To draw a spiral spring, draw the centre line A, and
lines B, C, Figure 215, distant apart the diameter
the spring is to be less the diameter of the wire of
which it is to be made. On the centre line A mark
two lines <i>a b</i>, <i>c d</i>, representing the pitch of the spring.
Divide the distance between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> into four equal divisions,
as by lines 1, 2, 3, letting line 3 meet line B.
Line <i>e</i> meeting the centre line at line <i>a</i>, and the line
B at its intersection with line 3, is the angle of the
coil on one side of the spring; hence it may be marked
in at all the locations, as at <i>e f</i>, etc. These lines give
at their intersections with the lines C and B the centres
for the half circles <i>g</i>, which being drawn, the sides
<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, etc., of the spring, may all be marked in. By
the lines <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, the other sides of the spring may
be marked in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>The end of the spring is usually marked straight
across, as at L. If it is required to draw the coils
curved instead of straight across, a template must be
made, the curve being obtained as already described
for threads. It may be pointed out, however, that to
obtain as accurate a division as possible of the lines
that divide the pitch, the pitch may be divided upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>[167]</span>
a diagonal line, as F, Figure 216, which will greatly
facilitate the operation.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, however, that the drawings of
a workshop are, where large quantities of the same
kind of work is done, varied in character to suit some
special departments&mdash;that is to say, special extra drawings
are made for these departments. In Figures

<p>To the two views shown there would be necessary
detail sketches of the set screws, gibbs, and keys, all
the rest being shown; the necessary dimensions being,
of course, marked on the general drawing and on the
details.</p>

<p>In so simple a thing as a connecting rod, however,
there would be no question as to how the parts go
together; hence detail drawings of each separate piece
would answer for the lathe or vise bands.</p>

<p>But in many cases this would not be the case, and
the drawing would require to show the parts put together,
and be accompanied with such detail sketches
as might be necessary to show parts that could not be
clearly defined in the general views.</p>

<p>The blacksmith, for example, is only concerned
with the making of the separate pieces, and has no
concern as to how the parts go together. Furthermore,
there are parts and dimensions in the general
drawing with which the blacksmith has nothing to do.</p>

<p>Thus the location and dimensions of the keyways,
the dimensions of the brasses, and the location of the
bolt holes, are matters that have no reference to the
blacksmith's work, because the keyways, bolt holes,
and set-screw holes would be cut out of the solid in
the machine shop. It is customary, therefore, to send
to the blacksmith shop drawings containing separate
views of each piece drawn to the shape it is to be
forged; and drawn full size, or else on a scale sufficiently
large to make each part show clearly without
close inspection, marking thereon the full sizes, and
stating beneath the number of pieces of each detail.
(As in Figure 222, which represents the iron work of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[174]</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page175" id="page175"></a></span>
the connecting rod in Figure 220). In some cases
the finished sizes are marked, and it is left to the
blacksmith's judgment how much to leave for the finishing.
This is undesirable, because either the blacksmith
is left to judge what parts are to be finished, or
else there must be on the drawing instructions on this
point, or else signs or symbols that are understood to
convey the information. It is better, therefore, to
make for the blacksmith a special sketch, and mark
thereon the full-forged sizes, stating on the drawing
that such is the case.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 412px;">
<a name="Fig_223" id="Fig_223"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0177-1.jpg" width="412" height="212" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 223</span></div>

<p>As to the material of which the pieces are to be
made, the greater part of blacksmith work is made of
wrought iron, and it is, therefore, unnecessary to write
"wrought iron" beneath each piece. When the pieces
are to be of steel, however, it should be marked on
the drawing and beneath the piece. In special cases,
as where the greater part of the work of the shop is
of steel, the rule may, of course, be reversed, and the
parts made of iron may be the ones marked, whereas
when parts are sometimes of iron, and at others of
steel, each piece should be marked.</p>

<p>As a general rule the blacksmith knows, from the
custom of the shop or the nature of the work, what
the quality or kind of iron is to be, and it is, therefore,
only in exceptional cases that they need to be mentioned
on the drawing. Thus in a carriage manufactory,
Norway or Swede iron will be found, as well as
the better grades of refined iron, but the blacksmith
will know what iron to use, for certain parts, or the
shop may be so regulated that the selection of the
iron is not left to him. In marking the number of
<span class='pagenum'>[176]</span>
pieces required, it is better to use the word "thus"
than the words "of this," or "off this," because it is
shorter and more correct, for the forging is not taken
off the drawing, nor is it of the same; the drawing
gives the shape and the size, and the word "thus"
conveys that idea better than "of," "off," or "like
this."</p>

<p>In shops where there are many of the same pieces
forged, the blacksmith is furnished with sheet-iron
templates that he can lay directly upon the forging
and test its dimensions at once, which is an excellent
plan in large work. Such templates are, of course,
made from the drawings, and it becomes a question
as to whether their dimensions should be the forged
or the finished ones. If they are the forged, they may
cause trouble, because a forging may have a scant
place that it is difficult for the blacksmith to bring up
to the size of the template, and he is in doubt whether
there is enough metal in the scant place to allow the
job to clean up. It is better, therefore, to make them
to finished sizes, so that he can see at once if the work
will clean up, notwithstanding the scant place. This
will lead to no errors in large work, because such
work is marked out by lines, and the scant part will
therefore be discovered by the machinist, who will
line out the piece accordingly.</p>

<p>Figure 223 is a drawing of a locomotive frame,
which the student may as well draw three or four
times as large as the engraving, which brings us to
the subject of enlarging or reducing scales.

<p>It is sometimes necessary to reduce a drawing to a
smaller scale, or to find a minute fraction of a given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[178]</span>
dimension, such fraction not being marked on the
lineal measuring rules at hand. Figure 224 represents
a scale for finding minute fractions. Draw
seven lines parallel to each other, and equidistant
draw vertical lines dividing the scale into half-inches,
as at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc. Divide the first space <i>e d</i> into
equal halves, draw diagonal lines, and number them
as in the figure. The distance of point 1, which is at
the intersection of diagonal with the second horizontal
line, will be 1/24 inch from vertical line <i>e</i>. Point 2 will
be 2/24 inch from line <i>e</i>, and so on. For tenths of inches
there would require to be but six horizontal lines, the
diagonals being drawn as before. A similar scale is
shown in Figure 225. Draw the lines A B, B D, D C,
<span class='pagenum'>[179]</span>
C A, enclosing a square inch. Divide each of these lines
into ten equal divisions, and number and letter them as
shown. Draw also the diagonal lines A 1, <i>a</i> 2, B 3,
and so on; then the distances from the line A C to
the points of intersection of the diagonals with the
horizontal lines represent hundredths of an inch.</p>

<p>Suppose, for example, we trace one diagonal line in
its path across the figure, taking that which starts from
A and ends at 1 on the top horizontal line; then where
the diagonal intersects <i>horizontal</i> line 1, is 99/100 from
the line B D, and 1/100 from the line A C, while where it
intersects <i>horizontal</i> line 2, is 98/100 from line B D, and
2/100 from line A C, and so on. If we require to set the
compasses to 67/100 inch, we set them to the radius of <i>n</i>,
and the figure 3 on line B D, because from that 3 to
the vertical line <i>d</i> 4 is 6/10 or 60/100 inch, and from that
vertical line to the diagonal at <i>n</i> is seven divisions
from the line C D of the figure.</p>

<p>In making a drawing to scale, however, it is an excellent
plan to draw a line and divide it off to suit the
required scale. Suppose, for example, that the given
scale is one-quarter size, or three inches per foot; then
a line three inches long may be divided into twelve
equal divisions, representing twelve inches, and these
may be subdivided into half or quarter inches and so
on. It is recommended to the beginner, however, to
spend all his time making simple drawings, without
making them to scale, in order to become so familiar
with the use of the instruments as to feel at home
with them, avoiding the complication of early studies
that would accompany drawing to scale.

<h3><i>PROJECTIONS.</i></h3>


<p>In projecting, the lines in one view are used to
mark those in other views, and to find their shapes or
curvature as they will appear in other views. Thus,
in Figure 225<i>a</i> we have a spiral, wound around a cylinder
whose end is cut off at an angle. The pitch of
the spiral is the distance A B, and we may delineate
the curve of the spiral looking at the cylinder from
two positions (one at a right-angle to the other, as is
shown in the figure), by means of a circle having a
circumference equal to that of the cylinder.</p>

<p>The circumference of this circle we divide into any
number of equidistant divisions, as from 1 to 24.
The pitch A B of the spiral or thread is then divided
off also into 24 equidistant divisions, as marked on
the left hand of the figure; vertical lines are then
drawn from the points of division on the circle to the
points correspondingly numbered on the lines dividing
the pitch; and where line 1 on the circle intersects
line 1 on the pitch is one point in the curve. Similarly,
where point 2 on the circle intersects line 2 on
the pitch is another point in the curve, and so on for
the whole 24 divisions on the circle and on the pitch.
In this view, however, the path of the spiral from line
7 to line 19 lies on the other side of the cylinder, and
is marked in dotted lines, because it is hidden by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[181]</span>
cylinder. In the right-hand view, however, a different
portion of the spiral or thread is hidden, namely from
<span class='pagenum'>[182]</span>
lines 1 to 13 inclusive, being an equal proportion to
that hidden in the left-hand view.</p>

<p>The top of the cylinder is shown in the left-hand
view to be cut off at an angle to the axis, and will
therefore appear elliptical; in the right-hand view, to
delineate this oval, the same vertical lines from the
circle may be carried up as shown on the right hand,
and horizontal lines may be drawn from the inclined
face in one view across the end of the other view, as
at P; the divisions on the circle may be carried up on
the right-hand view by means of straight lines, as Q,
and arcs of circle, as at R, and vertical lines drawn
from these arcs, as line S, and where these vertical
lines S intersect the horizontal lines as P, are points
in the ellipse.</p>

<p>Let it be required to draw a cylindrical body joining
another at a right-angle; as for example, a Tee,
such as in Figure 226, and the outline can all be
shown in one view, but it is required to find the line
of junction of one piece, A, with the other, B; that is,
find or mark the lines of junction C. Now when the
diameters of A and B are equal, the line of junction C
is a straight line, but it becomes a curved one when
the diameter of A is less than that of B, or <i>vice versa</i>;
hence it may be as well to project it in both cases.
For this purpose the three views are necessary. One-quarter
of the circle of B, in the end view, is divided
off into any number of equal divisions; thus we have
chosen the divisions marked <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, etc.; a
quarter of the top view is similarly divided off, as at
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>; from these points of division lines are
projected on to the side view, as shown by the dotted
<span class='pagenum'>[183]</span>
lines <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, etc., and where these lines meet,
as denoted by the dots, is in each case a point in the
line of junction of the two cylinders A, B.</p>

<p>Figure 227 represents a Tee, in which B is less in
diameter than A; hence the two join in a curve, which
is found in a similar manner, as is shown in Figure
<span class='pagenum'>[184]</span>
227. Suppose that the end and top views are drawn,
and that the side view is drawn in outline, but that
the curve of junction or intersection is to be found.
Now it is evident that since the centre line 1 passes
through the side and end views, that the face <i>a</i>, in the
<span class='pagenum'>[185]</span>
end view, will be even with the face <i>a'</i> in the side view,
both being the same face, and as the full length of the
side of B in the end view is marked by line <i>b</i>, therefore
line <i>c</i> projected down from <i>b</i> will at its junction
with line <i>b'</i>, which corresponds to line <i>b</i>, give the extreme
depth to which <i>b'</i> extends into the body A, and
therefore, the apex of the curve of intersection of B
with A. To obtain other points, we divide one-quarter
of the circumference of the circle B in the top view
into four equal divisions, as by lines <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, and from
the points of division we draw lines <i>j</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>g</i>, to the centre
line marked 2, these lines being thickened in the cut
for clearness of illustration. The compasses are
then set to the length of thickened line <i>g</i>, and from
point <i>h</i>, in the end view, as a centre, the arc <i>g'</i> is
marked. With the compasses set to the length of
thickened line <i>i</i>, and from <i>h</i> as a centre, arc <i>i'</i> is
marked, and with the length of thickened line <i>j</i> as a
radius and from <i>h</i> as a centre arc <i>j'</i> is marked; from
these arcs lines <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i> are drawn, and from the intersection
of <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, with the circle of A, lines <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i> are let
fall. From the lines of division, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, the lines <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>
are drawn, and where lines <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i> join lines <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, are
points in the curve, as shown by the dots, and by
drawing a line to intersect these dots the curve is
obtained on one-half of B. Since the axis of B is in
the same plane as that of A, the lower half of the
curve is of the same curvature as the upper, as is
shown by the dotted curve.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 229.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 228 the axis of piece B is not in the same
plane as that of D, but to one side of it to the distance
between the centre lines C, D, which is most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[186]</span>
clearly seen in the top view. In this case the process
is the same except in the following points: In the
side view the line <i>w</i>, corresponding to the line <i>w</i> in the
end view, passes within the line <i>x</i> before the curve of
intersection begins, and in transferring the lengths of
<span class='pagenum'>[187]</span>
the full lines <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i> to the end view, and marking
the arcs <i>b'</i>, <i>c'</i>, <i>d'</i>, <i>e'</i>, <i>f'</i>, they are marked from the
point <i>w</i> (the point where the centre line of B intersects
the outline of A), instead of from the point <i>x</i>.
In all other respects the construction is the same as
that in Figure 227.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 180px;">

<img src="images/drawing-0189-1.jpg" width="180" height="386" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 230.</span>
</div>

<p>In these examples the axis of B stands at a right-angle
to that of A. But in Figure 229 is shown the
construction where the axis of B is not at a right-angle
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[188]</span>
to A. In this case there is projected from B, in
the side view, an end view of B as at B', and across
this end at a right-angle to the centre line of B is
marked a centre line C C of B', which is divided
as before by lines <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, their respective
lengths being transferred from W as a centre, and
marked by the arcs <i>d'</i>, <i>e'</i>, <i>f'</i>, which are marked on a
vertical line and carried by horizontal lines, to the arc
of A as at <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>. From these points, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, the perpendicular
lines <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, are dropped, and where these lines
meet lines <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, are points in the curve of intersection
of B with A. It will be observed that each of
the lines <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, serves for two of the points in the
curve; thus, <i>m</i> meets <i>q</i> and <i>s</i>, while <i>n</i> meets <i>p</i> and <i>t</i>, and
<i>o</i> meets the outline on each side of B, in the side view,
and as <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i> are obtained from <i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, the lines
<i>g</i> and <i>h</i> might have been omitted, being inserted
merely for the sake of illustration.</p>

<p>In Figure 230 is an example in which a cylinder intersects
a cone, the axes being parallel. To obtain
the curve of intersection in this case, the side view is
divided by any convenient number of lines, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
etc., drawn at a right-angle to its axis A A, and from
one end of these lines are let fall the perpendiculars
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>; from the ends of these (where they meet
the centre line of A in the top view), half-circles <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>,
<i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, are drawn to meet the circle of B in the top view,
and from their points of intersection with B, lines <i>p</i>,
<i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, are drawn, and where these meet lines <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>,
<i>d</i> and <i>e</i>, which is at <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, are points in the curve.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed, on referring again to Figure 229,
that the branch or cylinder B appears to be of elliptical
<span class='pagenum'>[189]</span>
section on its end face, which occurs because it is
seen at an angle to its end surface; now the method
of finding the ellipse for any given degree of angle is
<span class='pagenum'>[190]</span>
as in Figure 231, in which B represents a cylindrical
body whose top face would, if viewed from point I, appear
as a straight line, while if viewed from point J it
would appear in outline a circle. Now if viewed from
point E its apparent dimension in one direction will
obviously be defined by the lines S, Z. So that if on a
line G G at a right angle to the line of vision E, we
mark points touching lines S, Z, we get points 1 and 2,
representing the apparent dimension in that direction
which is the width of the ellipse. The length of the
ellipse will obviously be the full diameter of the cylinder
B; hence from E as a centre we mark points 3
and 4, and of the remaining points we will speak
presently. Suppose now the angle the top face of B
is viewed from is denoted by the line L, and lines S', Z,
parallel to L, will be the width for the ellipse whose
length is marked by dots, equidistant on each side
of centre line G' G', which equal in their widths one
<span class='pagenum'>[191]</span>
from the other the full diameter of B. In this construction
the ellipse will be drawn away from the cylinder
B, and the ellipse, after being found, would have
to be transferred to the end of B. But since centre
line G G is obviously at the same angle to A A that
A A is to G G, we may start from the centre line of
the body whose elliptical appearance is to be drawn,
and draw a centre line A A at the same angle to G G
as the end of B is supposed to be viewed from. This
is done in Figure 231 <i>a</i>, in which the end face of B is
to be drawn viewed from a point on the line G G, but
at an angle of 45 degrees; hence line A A is drawn
at an angle of 45 degrees to centre line G G, and
centre line E is drawn from the centre of the end of B
at a right angle to G G, and from where it cuts A A, as
at F, a side view of B is drawn, or a single line of a
length equal to the diameter of B may be drawn at a
right angle to A A and equidistant on each side of F.
A line, D D, at a right angle to A A, and at any convenient
distance above F, is then drawn, and from its intersection
with A A as a centre, a circle C equal to the
diameter of B is drawn; one-half of the circumference
of C is divided off into any number of equal divisions
as by arcs <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>. From these points of
division, lines <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> are drawn, and also lines
<i>m</i>, <i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>. From the intersection of these last
lines with the face in the side view, lines <i>s</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>t</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>,
<i>y</i>, <i>z</i> are drawn, and from point F line E is drawn. Now
it is clear that the width of the end face of the cylinder
will appear the same from any point of view it may be
looked at, hence the sides H H are made to equal the
diameter of the cylinder B and marked up to centre
line E.<span class='pagenum'>[192]</span></p>

</div>

<p>It is obvious also that the lines <i>s</i>, <i>z</i>, drawn from the
extremes of the face to be projected will define the
width of the ellipse, hence we have four of the points
(marked respectively 1, 2, 3, 4) in the ellipse. To obtain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[193]</span>
the remaining points, lines <i>t</i>, <i>u</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>w</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> (which
start from the point on the face F where the lines <i>m</i>,
<i>n</i>, <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, respectively meet it) are drawn across the
face of B as shown. The compasses are then set to
the radius <i>g</i>; that is, from centre line D to division <i>a</i>
on the circle, and this radius is transferred to the face
to be projected the compass-point being rested at the
intersection of centre line G and line <i>t</i>, and two arcs
as 5 and 6 drawn, giving two more points in the curve
of the ellipse. The compasses are then set to the
length of line <i>h</i> (that is, from centre line D to point
of division <i>b</i>), and this distance is transferred, setting
the compasses on centre line G where it is intersected
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[194]</span>
by line <i>u</i>, and arcs 7, 8 are marked, giving two more
points in the ellipse. In like manner points 9 and 10
are obtained from the length of line <i>i</i>, 11 and 12 from
that of <i>j</i>; points 13 and 14 from the length of <i>k</i>, and
15 and 16 from <i>l</i>, and the ellipse may be drawn in from
these points.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out, however, that since points 5
and 6 are the same distance from G that points 15
and 16 are, and since points 7 and 8 are the same
distance from G that points 13 and 14 are, while
points 9 and 10 are the same distance from G that 11
and 12 are, the lines, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i> are unnecessary, since <i>l</i> and
<i>g</i> are of equal length, as are also <i>h</i> and <i>k</i> and <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>.
In Figure 232 the cylinders are line shaded to make
them show plainer to the eye, and but three lines (<i>a</i>,
<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) are used to get the radius wherefrom to mark
the arcs where the points in the ellipse shall fall; thus,
radius <i>a</i> gives points 1, 2, 3 and 4; radius <i>b</i> gives
points 5, 6, 7 and 8, and radius <i>c</i> gives 9, 10, 11 and
12, the extreme diameter being obtained from lines S,
Z, and H, H.</p>

<h3><i>DRAWING GEAR WHEELS.</i></h3>


<p>The names given to the various lines of a tooth on
a gear-wheel are as follows:</p>

<p>In Figure 233, A is the face and B the flank of a
tooth, while C is the point, and D the root of the
tooth; E is the height or depth, and F the breadth.
P P is the pitch circle, and the space between the two
teeth, as H, is termed a space.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 315px;">
<a name="Fig_234" id="Fig_234"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0196-1.jpg" width="315" height="354" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 234.</span>
</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 246px;">
<a name="Fig_235" id="Fig_235"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0198-1.jpg" width="246" height="370" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 235.</span>
</div>

<p>It is obvious that the points of the teeth and the
<span class='pagenum'>[196]</span>
bottoms of the spaces, as well as the pitch circle, are
concentric to the axis of the wheel bore. And to
pencil in the teeth these circles must be fully drawn,
as in Figure 234, in which P P is the pitch circle.
This circle is divided into as many equal divisions as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[197]</span>
the wheel is to have teeth, these divisions being
denoted by the radial lines, A, B, C, etc. Where
these divisions intersect the pitch circle are the centres
from which all the teeth curves may be drawn. The
compasses are set to a radius equal to the pitch, less
one-half the thickness of the tooth, and from a
centre, as R, two face curves, as F G, may be marked;
from the next centre, as at S, the curves D E may be
marked, and so on for all the faces; that is, the tooth
curves lying between the outer circle X and the pitch
circle P. For the flank curves, that is, the curve from
P to Y, the compasses are set to a radius equal to the
pitch; and from the sides of the teeth the flank curves
are drawn. Thus from J, as a centre flank, K is drawn;
from V, as a centre flank, H is drawn, and so on.</p>

<p>The proportions of the teeth for cast gears generally
accepted in this country are those given by Professor
Willis, as average practice, and are as follows:</p>



<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="Thread Detail">
<tr><td align='left'>Depth to pitch line,</td><td>3/10</td><td align='left'>of the</td><td align='left'>pitch.</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Working depth,</td><td align='left'>6/10</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='left'>"</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Whole depth,</td><td align='left'>7/10</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='left'>"</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Thickness of tooth,</td><td align='left'>5/11</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='left'>"</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Breadth of space,</td><td align='left'>6/11</td><td align='left'>"</td><td align='left'>"</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>Instead, however, of calculating the dimensions
these proportions give for any particular pitch, a diagram
or scale may be made from which they may be
taken for any pitch by a direct application of the
compasses. A scale of this kind is given in Figure
235, in which the line A B is divided into inches and
parts to represent the pitches; its total length representing
the coarsest pitch within the capacity of the
scale; and, the line B C (at a right-angle to A B) the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[198]</span>
whole depth of the tooth for the coarsest pitch, being
7/10 of the length of A B.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 144px;">
<a name="Fig_236" id="Fig_236"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0199-1.jpg" width="144" height="89" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 236.</span>
</div>

<p>The other diagonal lines are for the proportion of
the dimensions marked on the figure. Thus the
<span class='pagenum'>[199]</span>
depth of face, or distance from the pitch line to the
extremity or tooth point for a 4 inch pitch, would
be measured along the line B C, from the vertical line
B to the first diagonal. The thickness of the tooth
would be for a 4 inch pitch along line B C from B to
the second diagonal, and so on. For a 3 inch pitch
the measurement would be taken along the horizontal
line, starting from the 3 on the line A B, and so on.
On the left of the diagram or scale is marked the lbs.
strain each pitch will safely transmit per inch width
of wheel face, according to Professor Marks.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 126px;">
<a name="Fig_237" id="Fig_237"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0201-1.jpg" width="126" height="214" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 237.</span>
</div>

<p>The application of the scale as follows: The pitch
circles P P and P' P', Figure 236, for the respective
wheels, are drawn, and the height of the teeth is obtained
from the scale and marked beyond the pitch
circles, when circles Q and Q' may be drawn. Similarly,
the depths of the teeth within the pitch circles are
obtained from the scale or diagram and marked within
the respective pitch circles, and circles R and R' are
marked in. The pitch circles are divided off into as
many points of equal division, as at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, etc., as
the respective wheels are to have teeth, and the thickness
of tooth having been obtained from the scale, this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[200]</span>
thickness is marked from the points of division on the
pitch circles, as at <i>f</i> in the figure, and the tooth curves
may then be drawn in. It may be observed, however,
that the tooth thicknesses will not be strictly correct,
because the scale gives the same chord pitch for the
teeth on both wheels which will give different arc
pitches to the teeth on the two wheels; whereas, it is
the arc pitches, and not the chord pitches, that should
be correct. This error obviously increases as there
is a greater amount of difference between the two
wheels.</p>

<p>The curves given to the teeth in Figure 234 are
not the proper ones to transmit uniform motion, but
are curves merely used by draughtsmen to save the
trouble of finding the true curves, which if it be required,
may be drawn with a very near approach to
accuracy, as follows, which is a construction given by
Rankine:</p>

<p>Draw the rolling circle D, Figure 237, and draw A
D, the line of centres. From the point of contact at
C, mark on D, a point distant from C one-half the
amount of the pitch, as at P, and draw the line P C of
indefinite length beyond C. Draw the line P E passing
through the line of centres at E, which is equidistant
between C and A. Then increase the length of line
P F to the right of C by an amount equal to the
radius A C, and then diminish it to an amount equal
to the radius E D, thus obtaining the point F and the
latter will be the location of centre for compasses to
strike the face curve.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 159px;">

<img src="images/drawing-0202-1.jpg" width="159" height="132" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 239.</span>
</div>

<p>Another method of finding the face curve, with
compasses, is as follows: In Figure 238 let P P represent
<span class='pagenum'>[201]</span>
the pitch circle of the wheel to be marked, and
B C the path of the centre of the generating or describing
circle as it rolls outside of P P. Let the
point B represent the centre of the generating circle
when it is in contact with the pitch circle at A. Then
from B mark off, on B C, any number of equidistant
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[202]</span>
points, as D, E, F, G, H, and from A mark on the
pitch circle, with the same radius, an equal number of
points of division, as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. With the compasses
set to the radius of the generating circle, that
is, A B, from B, as a centre, mark the arc I, from D,
the arc J, from E, the arc K, from F, and so on, marking
as many arcs as there are points of division on B
C. With the compasses set to the radius of divisions
1, 2, etc., step off on arc M the five divisions, N, O,
S, T, V, and at V will be a point on the epicycloidal
curve. From point of division 4, step off on L four
points of division, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>; and <i>d</i> will be another
point on the epicycloidal curve. From point 3, set
off three divisions, and so on, and through the points
so obtained draw by hand, or with a scroll, the curve.</p>

<p>Hypocycloids for the flanks of the teeth maybe traced
in a similar manner. Thus in Figure 239, P P is the
pitch circle, and B C the line of motion of the centre
of the generating circle to be rolled within P P. From
1 to 6 are points of equal division on the pitch circle,
and D to I are arc locations for the centre of the generating
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[203]</span>
circle. Starting from A, which represents the
location for the centre of the generating circle, the
point of contact between the generating and base circles
will be at B. Then from 1 to 6 are points of
equal division on the pitch circle, and from D to I are
the corresponding locations for the centres of the generating
circle. From these centres the arcs J, K, L,
M, N, O, are struck. The six divisions on O, from <i>a</i>
to <i>f</i>, give at <i>f</i> a point in the curve. Five divisions
on N, four on M, and so on, give, respectively, points
in the curve.</p>

<p>There is this, however, to be noted concerning the
construction of the last two figures. Since the circle
described by the centre of the generating circle is
of a different arc or curve to that of the pitch circle,
the length of an arc having an equal radius on each
will be different. The amount is so small as to be
practically correct. The direction of the error is to
give to the curves a less curvature, as though they
had been produced by a generating circle of larger
diameter. Suppose, for example, that the difference
between the arc <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and its chord is .1, and that the
difference between the arc 4, 5, and its chord is .01,
then the error in one step is .09, and, as the point <i>f</i>
is formed in five steps, it will contain this error multiplied
five times. Point <i>d</i> would contain it multiplied
three times, because it has three steps, and so on.</p>

<p>The error will increase in proportion as the diameter
of the generating is less than that of the pitch
circle, and though in large wheels, working with large
wheels, so that the difference between the radius of
the generating circle and that of the smallest wheel is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[204]</span>
not excessive, it is so small as to be practically inappreciable,
yet in small wheels, working with large
ones, it may form a sensible error.

<p>For showing the dimensions through the arms and
hub, a sectional view of a section of the wheel may be
given, as in Figure 240, which represents a section of
a wheel, and a pinion, and on these two views all the

<p>If it is desired to draw an edge view of a wheel
(which the student will find excellent practice), the
lines for the teeth may be projected from the teeth in
the side view, as in Figure 240 <i>a</i>. Thus tooth E is
projected by drawing lines from the corners A, B, C,
in the side view across the face in the edge view, as
at A, B, C in the latter view, and similar lines may be
obtained in the same way for all the teeth.</p>

<p>When the teeth of wheels are to be cut to form in
a gear-cutting machine, the thickness of the teeth is
nearly equal to the thickness of the spaces, there being
just sufficient difference to prevent the teeth of one
wheel from becoming locked in the spaces of the other;
but when the teeth are to be cast upon the wheel, the
tooth thickness is made less than the width of the
space to an amount that is usually a certain proportion
of the pitch, and is termed the side clearance.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[208]</span>
In all wheels, whether with cut or cast teeth, there is
given a certain amount of top and bottom clearance;
that is to say, the points of the teeth of one wheel do
not reach to the bottom of the spaces in the other.
Thus in the Pratt and Whitney system the top and
bottom clearance is one-eighth of the pitch, while in
the Brown and Sharpe system for involute teeth the
clearance is equal to one-tenth the thickness of the
tooth.</p>

<p>In drawing bevil gear wheels, the pitch line of each
tooth on each wheel, and the surfaces of the points, as
well as those at the bottom of the spaces, must all
point to a centre, as E in Figure 241, which centre is
where the axes of the shafts would meet. It is unnecessary
to mark in the correct curves for the teeth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[209]</span>
for reasons already stated, with reference to the curves
for a spur wheel. But if it is required to do so, the
construction to find the curves is as shown in Figure
242, in which let A A represent the axis of one shaft,
and B that of the other of the pair of bevil wheels that
are to work together, their axes meeting at W; draw
the line E at a right angle to A A, and representing
the pitch circle diameter of one wheel, and draw F at
a right angle to B, and representing the pitch circle of
the other wheel; draw the line G G, passing through
the point W and the point T, where the pitch circles
or lines E F meet, and G G will be the line of contact
of the tooth of one wheel upon the tooth of the other
wheel; or in other words, the pitch line of the tooth.</p>

<p>Draw lines, as H and I, representing the tooth
breadth. From W, as a centre, draw on each side of
G G dotted lines, as P, representing the height of the
tooth above and below the pitch line G G. At a right
angle to G G draw the line J K; and from where this
line meets B, as at Q, mark the arc <i>a</i>, which will represent
the pitch circle for the large diameter of the pinion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[210]</span>
D. [The smallest wheel of a pair of gears is termed
the pinion.] Draw the arc <i>b</i> for the height, and circle <i>c</i>
for the depth of the teeth, thus defining the height of
the tooth at that end. Similarly from P, as a centre
mark (for the large diameter of wheel C,) arcs <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>,
and <i>i</i>, arc <i>g</i> representing the pitch circle, <i>i</i> the height,
and <i>h</i> the depth of the tooth. On these arcs draw
the proper tooth curves in the same manner as for
spur wheels; that is, obtain the curves by the construction
<span class='pagenum'>[211]</span>
shown in Figures 237, or by those in Figures 238
and 239.</p>

<p>To obtain the arcs for the other end of the tooth,
draw line M M parallel to line J K; set the compasses
to the radius R L, and from P, as a centre, draw the
pitch circle <i>k</i>. For the depth of the tooth draw the
dotted line <i>p</i>, meeting the circle <i>h</i> and the point W.
A similar line, from <i>i</i> to W, will give the height of the
tooth at its inner end. Then the tooth curves may be
drawn on these three arcs, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, in the same as if
they were for a spur wheel.</p>

<p>Similarly for the pitch circle of the inner and
small end of the pinion teeth, set the compasses to
radius S L, and from Q as a centre mark the pitch
circle <i>d</i>. Outside of <i>d</i> mark <i>e</i> for the height above
pitch lines of the tooth, and inside of <i>d</i> mark the arc
<i>f</i> for the depth below pitch line of the tooth at that
end. The distance between the dotted lines as <i>p</i>, represents
the full height of the tooth; hence <i>h</i> meets <i>p</i>,
which is the root of the tooth on the large wheel. To
give clearance and prevent the tops of the teeth on
one wheel from bearing against the bottoms of the
spaces in the other wheel, the point of the pinion
teeth is marked below; thus arc <i>b</i> does not meet <i>h</i> or
<i>p</i>, but is short to the amount of clearance. Having
obtained the arcs <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, the curves may be marked
thereon as for a spur wheel. A tooth thus marked is
shown at <i>x</i>, and from its curves between <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, a
template may be made for the large diameter or outer
end of the pinion teeth. Similarly for the wheel C
the outer end curves are marked on the arcs <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>,
and those for the other end of the tooth are marked
between the arcs <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>.

<p>Figure 243 represents a drawing of one-half of a
bevil gear, and an edge view projected from the same.
The point E corresponds to point E in Figure 241, or
W in 242. The line F shows that the top surface of the
teeth points to E. Line G shows that the pitch line
of each tooth points to E, and lines H show that the
bottom of the surface of a space also points to E.
Line 1 shows that the sides of each tooth point to E.
And it follows that the outer end of a tooth is both
higher or deeper and also thicker than its inner end;
thus J is thicker and deeper than end K of the tooth.
Lines F G, representing the top and bottom of a tooth
in Figure 243, obviously correspond to dotted lines <i>p</i>
in Figure 242. The outer and inner ends of the teeth
in the edge view are projected from the outer and
inner ends in the face view, as is shown by the dotted
lines carried from tooth L in the face view, to tooth L
in the edge view, and it is obvious from what has been
said that in drawing the lines for the tooth in the edge
view they will point to the centre E.

<p>To save work in drawing bevil gear wheels, they

thus in Figure 244 is shown a pair of bevil wheels
shown in section, and in Figure 245 is a drawing of a

are spur gears, while G H and I are bevil gears, the
cone surface on which the teeth lie being left blank,
save at the edges where a tooth is in each case drawn
in. Wheel D is shown in section so as to show the
means by which it may be moved out of gear with C
and E. Small bevil gears may also be represented by
simple line shading; thus in Figure 247 the two
bodies A and C would readily be understood to be a
bevil gear and pinion. Similarly small spur wheels
<span class='pagenum'>[217]</span></p>

<p>may be represented by simple circles in a side view
and by line shading in an edge view; thus it would
answer every practical purpose if such small wheels
as in Figures 246 and 247 at D, F, G, K, P, H, I and
J, were drawn as shown. The pitch circles, however,
are usually drawn in red ink to distinguish
them.</p>

<p>The construction of oval gearing is shown in
Figures 252, 253, 254, 255, and 256. The pitch-circle
is drawn by the construction for drawing an ellipse
that was given with reference to Figure 81, but as
that construction is by means of arcs of circles, and
therefore not strictly correct, Professor McCord, in an
article on elliptical gearing, says, concerning it and
the construction of oval gearing generally, as follows:
<span class='pagenum'>[221]</span></p>

<p>But these circular arcs may be rectified and subdivided
with great facility and accuracy by a very
simple process, which we take from Prof. Rankine's
"Machinery and Mill Work," and is illustrated in Figure
252. Let O B be tangent at O to the arc O D,
of which C is the centre. Draw the chord D O, bisect
it in E, and produce it to A, making O A=O E; with
centre A and radius A D describe an arc cutting the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[223]</span>
tangent in B; then O B will be very nearly equal in
length to the arc O D, which, however, should not
exceed about 60 degrees; if it be 60 degrees, the
error is theoretically about 1/900 of the length of the arc,
O B being so much too short; but this error varies with
the fourth power of the angle subtended by the arc,
so that for 30 degrees it is reduced to 1/16 of that
amount, that is, to 1/14400. Conversely, let O B be a tangent
of given length; make O F=1/4 O B; then with
centre F and radius F B describe an arc cutting the
circle O D G (tangent to O B at O) in the point D;
then O D will be approximately equal to O B, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[224]</span>
error being the same as in the other construction and
following the same law.</p>

<p>The extreme simplicity of these two constructions
and the facility with which they may be made with ordinary
drawing instruments make them exceedingly
convenient, and they should be more widely known
than they are. Their application to the present
problem is shown in Figure 253, which represents a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[225]</span>
quadrant of an ellipse, the approximate arcs C D,
E, E F, F A having been determined by trial and
error. In order to space this off, for the positions of
the teeth, a tangent is drawn at D, upon which is constructed
the rectification of D C, which is D G, and
also that of D E in the opposite direction, that is, D
H, by the process just explained. Then, drawing the
tangent at F, we set off in the same manner F I = F E,
and F K = F A, and then measuring H L = I K, we
have finally G L, equal to the whole quadrant of the
ellipse.</p>

<p>Let it now be required to lay out twenty-four teeth
upon this ellipse; that is, six in each quadrant; and
for symmetry's sake we will suppose that the centre
of one tooth is to be at A, and that of another at C,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[226]</span>
Figure 253. We, therefore, divide L G into six equal
parts at the points 1, 2, 3, etc., which will be the
centres of the teeth upon the rectified ellipse. It
is practically necessary to make the spaces a little
greater than the teeth; but if the greatest attainable
exactness in the operation of the wheels is aimed at,
it is important to observe that backlash, in elliptical
gearing, has an effect quite different from that resulting
in the case of circular wheels. When the pitch-curves
are circles, they are always in contact; and we
may, if we choose, make the tooth only half the
breadth of the space, so long as its outline is correct.
When the motion of the driver is reversed, the follower
will stand still until the backlash is taken up,
when the motion will go on with a perfectly constant
velocity ratio as before. But in the case of two elliptical
wheels, if the follower stand still while the driver
moves, which must happen when the motion is reversed
if backlash exists, the pitch-curves are thrown
out of contact, and, although the continuity of the
motion will not be interrupted, the velocity ratio will be
affected. If the motion is never to be reversed, the perfect
law of the velocity ratio due to the elliptical pitch-curve
may be preserved by reducing the thickness of
the tooth, not equally on each side, as is done in circular
wheels, but wholly on the side not in action.
But if the machine must be capable of acting indifferently
in both directions, the reduction must be made
on both sides of the tooth: evidently the action will be
slightly impaired, for which reason the backlash should
be reduced to a minimum. Precisely what <i>is</i> the
minimum is not so easy to say, as it evidently depends
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[227]</span>
much upon the excellence of the tools and the skill of
the workman. In many treatises on constructive
mechanism it is variously stated that the backlash
should be from one-fifteenth to one-eleventh of the
pitch, which would seem to be an ample allowance in
reasonably good castings not intended to be finished,
and quite excessive if the teeth are to be cut; nor is
it very obvious that its amount should depend upon
the pitch any more than upon the precession of the
equinoxes. On paper, at any rate, we may reduce it
to zero, and make the teeth and spaces equal in
breadth, as shown in the figure, the teeth being indicated
by the double lines. Those upon the portion
L H are then laid off upon K I, after which these divisions
are transferred to the ellipse by the second of
Prof. Rankine's constructions, and we are then ready
to draw the teeth.</p>

<p>The outlines of these, as of any other teeth upon
pitch-curves which roll together in the same plane,
depend upon the general law that they must be such
as can be marked out upon the planes of the curves,
as they roll by a tracing-point, which is rigidly connected
with and carried by a third line, moving in
rolling contact with both the pitch-curves. And since
under that condition the motion of this third line, relatively
to each of the others, is the same as though it
rolled along each of them separately while they remained
fixed, the process of constructing the generated
curves becomes comparatively simple. For the
describing line we naturally select a circle, which, in
order to fulfil the condition, must be small enough to
roll within the pitch ellipse; its diameter is determined
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[228]</span>
by the consideration that if it be equal to A P, the
radius of the arc A F, the flanks of the teeth in that
region will be radial. We have, therefore, chosen a
circle whose diameter, A B, is three-fourths of A P,
as shown, so that the teeth, even at the ends of the
wheels, will be broader at the base than on the pitch
line. This circle ought strictly to roll upon the true
elliptical curve; and assuming, as usual, the tracing-point
upon the circumference, the generated curves
would vary slightly from true epicycloids, and no two
of those used in the same quadrant of the ellipse
would be exactly alike. Were it possible to divide
the ellipse accurately, there would be no difficulty in
laying out these curves; but having substituted the
circular arcs, we must now roll the generating circle
upon these as bases, thus forming true epicycloidal
teeth, of which those lying upon the same approximating
arc will be exactly alike. Should the junction of
two of these arcs fall within the breadth of a tooth, as
at D, evidently both the face and the flank on one
side of that tooth will be different from those on the
other side; should the junction coincide with the edge
of a tooth, which is very nearly the case at F, then the
face on that side will be the epicycloid belonging to
one of the arcs, its flank a hypocycloid belonging to
the other; and it is possible that either the face or the
flank on one side should be generated by the rolling
of the describing circle partly on one arc, partly on
the one adjacent, which, upon a large scale, and where
the best results are aimed at, may make a sensible
change in the form of the curve.</p>

<p>The convenience of the constructions given in Figure
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[229]</span>
252 is nowhere more apparent than in the drawing
of the epicycloids, when, as in the case in hand
the base and generating circles may be of incommensurable
diameters; for which reason we have, in Figure
254, shown its application in connection with the
most rapid and accurate mode yet known of describing
those curves. Let C be the centre of the base
circle; B, that of the rolling one; A, the point of contact.
Divide the semi-circumference of B into six
equal parts at 1, 2, 3, etc.; draw the common tangent
at A, upon which rectify the arc A 2 by process No. 1;
then by process No. 2 set out an equal arc A 2 on the
base circle, and stepping it off three times to the right
and left, bisect these spaces, thus making subdivisions
on the base circle equal in length to those on the rolling
one. Take in succession as radii the chords A 1,
A 2, A 3, etc., of the describing circle, and with centres
1, 2, 3, etc., on the base circle, strike arcs either externally
or internally, as shown respectively on the right
and left; the curve tangent to the external arcs is the
epicycloid, that tangent to the internal ones the hypocycloid,
forming the face and flank of a tooth for the
base circle.</p>

complete, we show in Figure 255 the pair in gear, on

illustration. Figure 255 will serve also to call attention
to another serious circumstance, which is, that
<span class='pagenum'>[230]</span>
although the ellipses are alike, the wheels are not;
nor can they be made so if there be an even number
of teeth, for the obvious reason that a tooth upon one
wheel must fit into a space on the other; and since in
the first wheel, Figure 255, we chose to place a tooth
at the extremity of each axis, we must in the second
one place there a space instead; because at one time
the major axes must coincide; at another, the minor
axes, as in Figure 255. If, then, we use even numbers,
the distribution, and even the forms of the teeth,
are not the same in the two wheels of the pair. But
this complication may be avoided by using an odd
number of teeth, since, placing a tooth at one extremity
of the major axes, a space will come at the other.
<span class='pagenum'>[231]</span></p>

<p>It is not, however, always necessary to cut teeth all
round these wheels, as will be seen by an examination
of Figure 256, C and D being the fixed centres of the
two ellipses in contact at P. Now P must be on the
line C D, whence, considering the free foci, we see
that P B is equal to P C, and P A to P D; and the
common tangent at P makes equal angles with C P
and P A, as is also with P B and P D; therefore, C D
being a straight line, A B is also a straight line and
equal to C D. If then the wheels be overhung, that
is, fixed on the ends of the shafts outside the bearings,
leaving the outer faces free, the moving foci may be
connected by a rigid link A B, as shown.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 256.</span>
</div>

<p>This link will then communicate the same motion
that would result from the use of the complete elliptical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[232]</span>
wheels, and we may therefore dispense with the
most of the teeth, retaining only those near the extremities
of the major axes, which are necessary in
order to assist and control the motion of the link
at and near the dead-points. The arc of the pitch-curves
through which the teeth must extend will vary
with their eccentricity; but in many cases it would not
be greater than that which in the approximation may
be struck about one centre; so that, in fact, it would
not be necessary to go through the process of rectifying
and subdividing the quarter of the ellipse at all,
as in this case it can make no possible difference
whether the spacing adopted for the teeth to be cut
would "come out even" or not, if carried around the
curve. By this expedient, then, we may save not only
the trouble of drawing, but a great deal of labor in
making, the teeth round the whole ellipse. We might
even omit the intermediate portions of the pitch
ellipses themselves; but as they move in rolling contact
their retention can do no harm, and in one part
of the movement will be beneficial, as they will do
part of the work; for if, when turning, as shown by
the arrows, we consider the wheel whose axis is D as
the driver, it will be noted that its radius of contact,
C P, is on the increase; and so long as this is the case
the other wheel will be compelled to move by contact
of the pitch lines, although the link be omitted. And
even if teeth be cut all round the wheels, this link is
a comparatively inexpensive and a useful addition to
the combination, especially if the eccentricity be considerable.
Of course the wheels shown in Figure 255
might also have been made alike, by placing a tooth
<span class='pagenum'>[233]</span>
at one end of the major axis and a space at the other,
as above suggested. In regard to the variation in the
velocity ratio, it will be seen, by reference to Figure
256, that if D be the axis of the driver, the follower
will in the position there shown move faster, the ratio of
the angular velocities being P &times; D/P &times; B; if the driver turn
uniformly, the velocity of the follower will diminish,
until at the end of half a revolution, the velocity ratio
will be P &times; B/P &times; D; in the other half of the revolution these
changes will occur in a reverse order. But P D = L
B; if then the centres B D are given in position, we
know L P, the major axis; and in order to produce
any assumed maximum or minimum velocity ratio, we
have only to divide L P into segments whose ratio is
equal to that assumed value, which will give the foci
of the ellipse, whence the minor axis may be found
and the curve described. For instance, in Figure 255
the velocity ratio being nine to one at the maximum,
the major axis is divided into two parts, of which one
is nine times as long as the other; in Figure 256 the
ratio is as one to three, so that the major axis being
divided into four parts, the distance A C between the
foci is equal to two of them, and the distance of either
focus from the nearest extremity of the major axis is
equal to one, and from the more remote extremity is
equal to three of these parts.

<p>Let it be required to find how much motion an
eccentric will give to its rod, the distance from the
centre of its bore to the centre of the circumference,
which is called the throw, being the distance from A
to B in Figure 257. Now as the eccentric is moved
around by the shaft, it is evident that the axis of its
motion will be the axis A of the shaft. Then from A
as a centre, and with radius from A to C, we draw the
dotted circle D, and from E to F will be the amount
of motion of the rod in the direction of the arrow.
<span class='pagenum'>[235]</span></p>

<p>This becomes obvious if we suppose a lead pencil
to be placed against the eccentric at E, and suppose
the eccentric to make half a revolution, whereupon
the pencil will be pushed out to F. If now we measure
the distance from E to F, we shall find it is just twice
that from A to B. We may find the amount of motion,
however, in another way, as by striking the dotted
half circle G, showing the path of motion of B, the
diameter of this path of motion being the amount of
lateral motion given to the rod.</p>

<p>In Figure 258 is a two arm lever fast upon the
same axis or shaft, and it is required to find how much
a given amount of motion of the long arm will move
the short one. Suppose the distance the long arm
moves is to A. Then draw the line B from A to the
axis of the shaft, and the line C the centre line of the
long arm. From the axis of the shaft as a centre,
draw the circle D, passing through the eye or centre
E of the short arm. Take the radius from F to G,
and from E as a centre mark it on D as at H, and H
is where E will be when the long arm moves to A.
<span class='pagenum'>[236]</span>
We have here simply decreased the motion in the
same proportion as one arm is shorter than the other.
The principle involved is to take the motion of both
arms at an equal distance from their axis of motion,
which is the axis of the shaft S.</p>

<p>In Figure 259 we have a case in which the end of a
lever acts directly upon a shoe. Now let it be required
to find how much a given motion of the lever
will cause the shoe to slide along the line <i>x</i>; the point
H is here found precisely as before, and from it as a
centre, the dotted circle equal in diameter to the small
circle at E is drawn from the perimeter of the dotted
circle, a dotted line is carried up and another is carried
up from the face of the shoe. The distance K
between these dotted lines is the amount of motion of
the shoe.</p>

<p>In Figure 260 we have the same conditions as in Figure
259, but the short arm has a roller acting against a
larger roller R. The point H is found as before. The
amount of motion of R is the distance of K from J;
hence we may transfer this distance from the centre of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page237" id="page237"></a>[237]</span>
R, producing the point P, from which the new position
may be marked by a dotted circle as shown.</p>

<p>In Figure 261 a link is introduced in place of the roller,
and it is required to find the amount of motion of
rod R. The point H is found as before, and then the
length from centre to centre of link L is found, and
with this radius and from H as a centre the arc P
is drawn, and where P intersects the centre line J of
R is the new position for the eye or centre Q of R.</p>

<p>In Figure 262 we have a case of a similar lever actuating
a plunger in a vertical line, it being required to find
how much a given amount of motion of the long arm will
actuate the plunger. Suppose the long arm to move
<span class='pagenum'>[238]</span>
to A, then draw the lines B C and the circle D. Take
the radius or distance F, G, and from E mark on D
the arc H. Mark the centre line J of the rod. Now
take the length from E to I of the link, and from H as
a centre mark arc K, and at the intersection of K
with J is where the eye I will be when the long arm
has moved to A.</p>

<p>In Figure 263 are two levers upon their axles or
shafts S and S'; arm A is connected by a link to arm
B, and arm C is connected direct to a rod R. It is required
to find the position of centre G of the rod eye
when D is in position E, and when it is also in position
F. Now the points E and F are, of course, on an arc
struck from the axis S, and it is obvious that in whatever
position the centre H may be it will be somewhere
on the arc I, I, which is struck from the centre
S'. Now suppose that D moves to E, and if we take
<span class='pagenum'>[239]</span>
the radius D, H, and from E mark it upon the arc I as
at V, then H will obviously be the new position of H.
To find the new position of G we first strike the arc
J, J, because in every position of G it will be somewhere
on the arc J, J. To find where that will be
when H is at V, take the radius H, G, and from V as
a centre mark it on J, J, as at K, which is the position
of G when D is at E and H is at V. For the positions
when D is at F we repeat the process, taking the
radius D, H, and from F marking P, and with the
radius H, G, and from P as a centre marking Q; then
P is the new position for H, and Q is that for G.</p>

<p>In Figure 264 a lever arm A and cam C are in one

line Q from the shaft axis through P, and mark point
T. From the shaft axis as a centre draw from T an
arc, cutting J at V, and V is the point where the face

<p>Let it be required to find the amount of motion imparted
in a straight line to a rod attached to an eccentric
strap, and the following construction may be used.
In Figure 265 let A represent the centre of the shaft,
and, therefore, the axis about which the eccentric revolves.
Let B represent the centre of the eccentric,
and let it be required to find in what position on the
line of motion <i>x</i>, the centre C of the rod eye will be
when the centre B of the eccentric has moved to E.
Now since A is the axis, the centre B of the eccentric
must rotate about it as denoted by the circle D, and
all that is necessary to find the position of C for any
position of eccentric is to mark the position of B on
circle D, as at E, and from that position, as from E,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[241]</span>
as a centre, and with the length of the rod as a radius,
mark the new position of C on the line <i>x</i> of its motion.
With the centre of the eccentric at B, the line
Q, representing the faces of the straps, will stand at a
right angle to the line of motion, and the length of the
rod is from B to C; when the eccentric centre moves
to E, the centre line of the rod will be moved to position
P, the line Q will have assumed position R, and
point C will have moved from its position in the drawing
to G on line <i>x</i>. If the eccentric centre be supposed
to move on to F, the point C will move to H,
the radii B C, E G, and F H all being equal in length.
Now when the eccentric centre is at E it will have
moved one-quarter of a revolution, and yet the point C
will only have moved to G, which is not central between
C and H, as is denoted by the dotted half
circle I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 297px;">
<a name="Fig_265" id="Fig_265"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0241-1.jpg" width="297" height="178" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 265.</span>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, while the eccentric centre is
<span class='pagenum'>[242]</span>
moving from E to F, which is but one-quarter of a
revolution, the rod end will move from G to H. This
occurs because the rod not only moves <i>endwise</i>, but
the end connected to the eccentric strap moves towards
and away from the line <i>x</i>. This is shown in
the figure, the rod centre line being marked in full line
from B to <i>x</i>. And when B has moved to E, the rod
centre line is marked by dotted line E, so that it has
moved away from the line of motion B <i>x</i>. In Figure
266 the eccentric centre is shown to stand at an angle
of 45 degrees from line <i>q</i>, which is at a right angle
to the line of motion <i>x x</i>, and the position of the rod
end is shown at C, J and H representing the extremes
of motion, and G the centre of the motion.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 283px;">
<a name="Fig_266" id="Fig_266"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0242-1.jpg" width="283" height="174" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 266.</span>
</div>

<p>If now we suppose the eccentric centre to stand at
T, which is also an angle of 45 degrees to <i>q</i>, then the
rod end will stand at K, which is further away from G
than C is; hence we find that on account of the movement
<span class='pagenum'>[243]</span>
of the rod out of the straight end motion, the
motion of the rod end becomes irregular in proportion
to that of the eccentric, whose action in moving the
eye C of the rod in a straight line is increased (by the
rod) while it is moving through the half rotation denoted
by V in figure, and diminished during the other
half rotation.</p>

<p>In many cases, as, for example, on the river steamboats
in the Western and Southern States, cams are
employed instead of eccentrics, and the principles involved
in drawing or marking out such cams are given
in the following remarks, which contain the substance
of a paper read by Lewis Johnson before the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers. In Figure 267 is a
side view of a pair of cams; one, C, being a full stroke
cam for operating the valve that admits steam to the
engine cylinder; and the other, D, being a cam to cut
off the steam supply at the required point in the engine
stroke. The positions of these cams with relation to
the position of the crank-pin need not be commented
upon here, more than to remark that obviously the
cam C must operate to open the steam inlet valve in
advance of cam D, which operates to close it and
cause the steam to act expansively in the cylinder, and
that the angle of the throw line of the cut-off valve D
to the other cam or to the crank-pin varies according
as it is required to cut off the steam either earlier or
later in the stroke.</p>

<p>The cam yoke is composed of two halves, Y and
Y', bolted together by bolts B, which have a collar at
one end and two nuts at the other end, the inner nuts
N N enabling the letting together of the two halves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 243px;">
<a name="Fig_267" id="Fig_267"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0244-1.jpg" width="243" height="455" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 267.</span>
</div><p><span class='pagenum'>[245]</span></p>

<p>of the yoke to take up the wear. It is obvious that
as the shaft revolves and carries the cam with it, it
will, by reason of its shape, move the yoke back and
forth; thus, in the position of the parts shown in Figure
267, the direction of rotation being denoted by the
arrow, cam C will, as it rotates, move the yoke to the
left, and this motion will occur from the time corner <i>a</i>
of the cam meets the face of Y' until corner <i>b</i> has
passed the centre line <i>d</i>. Now since that part of the
circumference lying between points <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> of the
cam is an arc of a circle, of which the axis of the shaft
is the centre, the yoke will remain at rest until such
time as <i>b</i> has passed line <i>d</i> and corner <i>a</i> meets the jaw
Y of the yoke; hence the period of rest is determined
by the amount of circumference that is made concentric
to the shaft; or, in other words, is determined by
the distance between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The object of using a cam instead of an eccentric is
to enable the opening of the valves abruptly at the
beginning of the piston stroke, maintaining a uniform
steam-port opening during nearly the entire length of
stroke, and as abruptly closing the valves at the termination
of the stroke.</p>

<p>Figure 268 is a top view of the mechanism in Figure
267; and Figure 269 shows an end view of the yoke.
At B, in Figure 268, is shown a guide through which
the yoke-stem passes so as to be guided to move in a
straight line, there being a guide of this kind on each
side of the yoke.</p>

<p>The two cams are bolted to a collar that is secured
to the crank-shaft, and are made in halves, as shown
in the figures and also in Figures 270 and 271, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[246]</span>
represent cams removed from the other mechanism.
To enable a certain amount of adjustment of the cams
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[247]</span>
upon the collar, the bolts which hold them to the collar
fit closely in the holes in the collar, but the cams are
provided with oblong bolt holes as shown, so that the
position of either cam, either with relation to the other
cam or with relation to the crank-pin, can be adjusted
to the extent permitted by the length of the oblong
holes.</p>

<p>The crank is assumed in the figures to be on its
dead centre nearest to the engine cylinder, and to revolve
in the direction of the arrows. The cams are
<span class='pagenum'>[248]</span>
so arranged that their plain unflanged surfaces bolt
against the collar.</p>

<p>The method of drawing or marking out a full stroke
cam, such as C in Figure 267, is illustrated in Figure
272, in which the dimensions are assumed to be as
follows:</p>

<p>Diameter of crank shaft, 7-1/2 inches; travel of cam,
3 inches; width of yoke, 18 inches.</p>

<p>The circumference of the cam is composed of four
curved lines, P, P', K 1, and K 2. The position of the
centre of the crank shaft in this irregularly curved
body is at X. The arcs K 1 and K 2 differ in radius,
but are drawn from the same point, X, and hence are
concentric with the crank shaft.</p>

<p>The arcs P, P', are of like radius, but are drawn from
the opposite points S, S', shown at the intersection of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[249]</span>

<p>The engravings from and including Figure 274
illustrate the lines embracing cut-off cams of varying
limits of cut-off, but all of like travel and dimensions,
which are the same as those given for the full stroke
cam in Figure 272.<span class='pagenum'>[252]</span></p>

<p>In drawing cut-off cams, the stroke of the engine
plays a part in determining their conformation, and in
the examples shown this is assumed to be 4 feet.
Figure 274 illustrates the manner of finding essential
points in drawing or marking out cut-off cams. With
X as a centre, and a radius of 2 feet, draw the circle
E 1, showing the path of the crank-pin in making a
revolution. This circle has a diameter of 4 feet, equal
to the stroke of the engine. Draw the horizontal
line B, passing through the centre of circle E 1.
Within the limits of circle E 1, subdivide line B into
eight equal parts, as at 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Draw the vertical
lines, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., until they each intersect the
circle E 1.</p>



<p>With X as a centre, draw the circle E, having a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[253]</span>
diameter of 18 inches, equal to the space in the yoke
embracing the cam.</p>

<p>From the centre X draw the series of radial lines
through the points of intersection of the vertical lines
1, 2, 3, 4, etc., from the circle E 1, and terminating at
X. We will now proceed to utilize the scale afforded
by Figure 274, in laying off the cut-off cam shown in
Figure 276, of half stroke limit.</p>

<p>With X as a centre, draw the circle E, Figure 275,
having a diameter of 18 inches. Bisect this circle
with the straight lines A and B, which bear the same
<span class='pagenum'>[254]</span>
relation to their enclosing circle that the lines A, B, do
to the circle E in Figure 274.</p>



<p>It will be observed, in Figure 274, that the vertical
line A is (at the top half) also No. 4, representing 4/8, or
half of the stroke. With a radius of 18 inches, and
one point of the dividers placed at V, which is at the
intersection of the circle E with the horizontal line B
in Figure 275, draw the arc P. With the same radius
and with one compass point rested at V', draw the arc
P'; then two arcs, P and P', intersecting at the point S.</p>

<p>With the same radius and one point of the compasses
at S, draw the arc H H. The arcs K 1 and K
2 are drawn from the centre X, with a radius of 10-1/2
for K 1 and 7-1/2 inches for K 2, and only serve in a
<span class='pagenum'>[255]</span>
half stroke cam to intersect the curved lines already
drawn, as shown in Figure 275. In practice, the sharp
corner at S would be objectionable, owing to rapid
wear at this point; and hence a modification of the
dimensions for this half stroke cam would be required
to obtain a larger wearing surface at the point S, but
the cam of this limit (1/2 stroke) is correctly drawn
by the process described with reference to Figure 275,
the outline of the cam so constructed being shown in
Figure 276.</p>

<p>In Figure 278 is shown a cam designed to cut off
the steam at five-eighths of the piston stroke, the construction
<span class='pagenum'>[256]</span>
lines being given in Figure 277, for which draw
circle E and straight lines A and B, as in the preceding
example. By reference to Figure 274 it will be observed
that the diagonal line drawn through circle E at
5 is drawn from the straight line marked 5, which intersects
circle E 1, and as this straight line 5 represents
five-eighths of the stroke laid off on line B, it determines
the limit of cut-off on the five-eighths cam in
Figure 277.</p>

<p>Turning then to Figure 274, take on circle E the
radius from radial line 4 to radial line 5, and mark
it in Figure 277 from the vertical line producing V'.</p>

<p>Now, with a radius of 18 inches, and one point of
the dividers fixed at point V, forming the intersection
of the circle E with the horizontal line B, draw the arc
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[257]</span>
P. With the same radius, and one point of the dividers
fixed at point V', draw the opposite arc P'. With a
radius of 10-1/2 inches from the centre X, draw the arc
K 1, intersecting lines P P', at S S. With a radius of
7-1/2 inches, draw the curved line K 2, opposite to
curved line K 1. Now, with a radius of 18 inches,
and one point of the dividers fixed alternately at S S,
draw the arcs H, H, from their intersection with the
circle E, until they merge into the curved line K 2.
These curved lines embrace a cut-off cam of five-eighths
limit, shown complete in Figure 278.</p>

<p>From the instructions already given it should be easy
to understand that the three-fourths and seven-eighths
cams, shown in Figures 279, 280, 281 and 282, are
<span class='pagenum'>[258]</span>
drawn by taking the points of their cut-off from the
same scale shown in Figure 274, at the diagonal points
6 and 7, intersecting circle E in that figure; and cut-off
cams of intermediate limit of cut-off can be drawn by
further subdividing the stroke line B, in Figure 274,
into the required limits.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 281.</span>
</div>

<p>Cut-off cams of any limit are necessarily imperfect
in their operations as to uniformity of cut-off from
opposite ends of the slides, not from any defect in the
rule for laying them off, but from the well-known fact
of the crank pin travelling a greater distance, while
driven by the piston from the centre of the cylinder,
through its curved path from the cylinder, over its
centre, and back to the centre of the cylinder, than in
accomplishing the remaining distance of its path in
making a complete revolution; and, although the subdivisions
<span class='pagenum'>[259]</span>
of eighths of the stroke line B, in Figure
274, does not truly represent a like division of the
piston stroke, owing to deviation, caused by inclination
of the connecting rod in traversing from the centres
to half stroke, still it will be found that laying off a
cut-off cam by this rule is more nearly correct than
if the divisions on stroke line B were made to correspond
exactly with a subdivision of piston stroke
into eighths.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;">
<a name="Fig_282" id="Fig_282"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0259-1.jpg" width="200" height="221" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 282.</span>
</div>

<p>The cut-off in cams laid off by the rules herein described
is greater in travelling from one side of the
slides than in travelling from the opposite end, one
cut-off being more than the actual cut-off of piston
stroke, and the other less; and in practical use, owing
to play or lost motion in the connections from cam to
<span class='pagenum'>[260]</span>
valve, the actual cut-off is less than the theoretical;
hence cut-off cams are usually laid off to compensate
for lost motion; that is, laid off with more limit; for
instance, a five-eighths cam would be laid off to cut-off
at eleven-sixteenths instead of five-eighths.</p>

<p>Figure 283 represents the motion a crank, C, imparts
to a connecting rod, represented by the thick
<span class='pagenum'>[261]</span>
line R, whose end, B, is supposed to be guided to move
in a straight line. The circle H represents the path
of the crank-pin, and dots 1, 2, 3, etc., are 24 different
crank-pin positions equidistant on the circle of
crank-pin revolution. Suppose the crank-pin to have
moved to position 1, and with the compasses set to the
length of the rod R, we set one point on the centre of
position 1, and mark on the line of motion <i>m</i> the line
<i>a</i>, which will be the position rod end B will have moved
to. Suppose next that the crank-pin has moved into
position 2, and with the compass point on the centre
of 2 we mark line 2, showing that while the crank-pin
moved from 1 to 2, the rod end moved from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>; by
continuing this process we are enabled to discern the
motion for the whole of the stroke. The backward
stroke will be the same, for corresponding crank-pin
positions, for both strokes; thus, when the rod end is
at 7 the crank-pin may be at 7 or at 17. This fact
enables us to find the positions for the positions later
than 6, on the other side of the circle, as at 17, 16, 15,
etc., which keeps the engraving clear.</p>

<p>In Figure 284 a pinion, P, drives a gear-wheel, D,
on which there is a pin driving the sliding die A in the
link L, which is pivoted at C, and connected at its upper
end to a rod, R, which is connected to a bolt, B, fast to
a slide, S. It is required to find the motion of S, it
moving in a straight line, dotted circle H' representing
the path of the pin in the sliding die A, arc H representing
the line of motion of the upper end of link L,
and lines N, O, its centre line at the extreme ends of
its vibrating motion. In Figure 285 the letters of reference
refer to the same parts as those in Figure 284.
<span class='pagenum'>[262]</span>
We divide the circle H' of pin motion into 24 equidistant
parts marked by dots, and through these we
draw lines radiating from centre, C, and cutting arc
H, obtaining on the arc H the various positions for
end Z of rod R, these positions being marked respectively
<span class='pagenum'>[263]</span>
1, 2, 3, 4, etc., up to 24. With a pair of compasses
set to the length of rod R from 1 on H, as a
centre, we mark on the line of motion of the slide, line
<i>a</i>, which shows where the other end of rod R will be
(or in other words, it shows the position of bolt B in
Figure 284), when the centre of A, Figure 284, is in
position 1, Figure 285.</p>

<p>From 2 on arc H, we mark with the compasses line
<i>b</i> on line M, showing that while the pin moved from 1
to 2, the rod R would move slide S, Figure 284, from
<i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, in Figure 285. From 3 we mark <i>c</i>, and so on,
all these marks being above the horizontal line M,
representing the line of motion, and being for the forward
stroke. For the backward stroke we draw the
dotted line from position 17 up to arc H, and with the
compasses at 17 mark a line beneath the line M of
motion, pursuing the same course for all the other
pin motions, as 18, 19, etc., until the pin arrives again
at position 24, and the link at O, and has made a full
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[264]</span>

stroke above and that of the backward one below the

<p>Figures 286 and 287 represent the Whitworth quick
return motion that is employed in many machines. F
represents a frame supporting a fixed journal, B, on
<span class='pagenum'>[265]</span>
which revolves a gear-wheel, G, operated by a pinion,
P. At A is an arm having journal bearing in B at C.
This arm is driven by a pin, D, fast in the gear, G;
hence as the gear revolves, pin D moves A around on
C as a centre of motion. A is provided with a slot
carrying a pin, X, on which is pivoted the rod, R.
The motion of end N of the rod R being in a straight
line, M, it is required to find the positions of N during
twenty-four periods in one revolution of G. In Figure
288 let H' represent the path of motion of the driving
pin D, about the centre of B, and H the path of motion
of X about the centre C; these two centres corresponding
to the centres of B and C respectively, in
Figure 287. Let the line M correspond to the line
of motion M in Figure 286. Now since it is the pin
D, Figure 287, that drives, and since its speed of revolution
is uniform, we divide its circle of motion H' into
twenty-four equal divisions, and by drawing lines radiating
from centre C, and passing through the lines of division
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[266]</span>
on H' we get on circle H twenty-four positions for
the pin X in Figure 286. Then setting the compasses
to the length of the rod (R, Figure 286), we mark from
position 1 on circle H as a centre line, <i>a</i>; from position
2 on H we mark line <i>b</i>, and so on for the whole twenty-four
positions on circle H, obtaining from <i>a</i> to <i>n</i> for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[267]</span>
forward, and from <i>n</i> to <i>y</i> for the motion during the
backward stroke. Suppose now that the mechanism
remaining precisely the same as before, the line M of
motion be in a line with the centres C, B, instead of at
a right angle to it, as it is in Figure 286, and the motion
under this new condition will be as in Figure 289; the
process for finding the amount of motion along M
from the motion around H being precisely as before.

<span class="caption">Fig. 290.</span>
</div>

<p>In Figure 290 is shown a cutter-head for a wood
moulding machine, and it is required to find what
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[269]</span>
shape the cutting edge of the cutter must be to form
a moulding such as is shown in the end view of the
moulding in the figure. Now the line A A being at
a right angle to the line of motion of the moulding as
it is passed beneath the revolving cutter, or, what is
the same thing, at a right angle to the face of the
table on which the moulding is moved, it is obvious
that the highest point C of the moulding will be cut to
shape by the point C of the cutter; and that since the
line of motion of the end of the cutter is the arc D,
the lowest part of the cutter action upon the moulding
will be at point E. It will also be obvious that as the
cutter edge passes, at each point, its length across the
line A A, it forms the moulding to shape, while all the
cutting action that occurs on either side of that line is
serving simply to remove material. All that we have
to consider, therefore, is the action on line A A.</p>

<p>It may be observed also that the highest point C of
the cutter edge must not be less than 1/4 inch from the
corner of the cutter head, which gives room for the
nut N (that holds the cutter to the head) to pass over
the top of the moulding in a 2-1/2 inch head. In proportion
as the heads are made larger, however, less
clearance is necessary for the nut, as is shown in Figure
291, the cutter edge extending to C, and therefore
nearly up to the corner of the head. Its path of motion
at C is shown by dotted arc B, which it will be
observed amply clears the nut N. In practice, however,
point C is not in any size of cutter-head placed
nearer than 1/4 inch from corner X of the cutter-head.</p>

<p>To find the length of the cutter edge necessary to
produce a given depth of moulding, we may draw a
<span class='pagenum'>[270]</span>
circle <i>i</i>, Figure 292, equal in diameter to the size of
the cutter head to be used, and line A A. The
highest point of cutting edge being at <i>e</i>, and the
lowest at g, then circles <i>d</i> and <i>f</i> represent the line of
motion of these two points; and if we mark the cutter
in, the necessary length of cutting edge on the cutter
is obviously from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 204px;">

<span class="caption">Fig. 292.</span>
</div>

<p>Now the necessary depth of cutter edge being found
for any given moulding, or part of a moulding, the
curves for the edge may be found as follows: Suppose
the moulding is to be half round, as in the end
view in Figure 290. The width of the cutter must
of course equal the width of the moulding, and the
length or depth of cutting edge required may be
<span class='pagenum'>[271]</span>
found from the construction shown in Figure 292;
hence all that remains is to find the curve for the cutting
edge. In Figure 293, let A A represent the centre
of the cutter width, its sides being F F', and its end B B.
From centre C draw circle D, the upper half of which
will serve to represent the moulding. Mark on A the
length or depth the cutting edge requires to be, ascertaining
the same from the construction shown in Figure
292, and mark it as from C to K'. Then draw line
E E, passing through point K. Draw line G, standing
at the same angle to A A as the face <i>h b</i>, Figure 292,
of the cutter does to the line A A, and draw line H
H, parallel to G. From any point on G, as at I, with
radius J, draw a quarter of a circle, as K. Mark off
this quarter circle into equal points of division, as by
1, 2, 3, etc., and from these points of division draw
<span class='pagenum'>[272]</span>
lines, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, etc.; and from these lines draw horizontal
lines <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, etc. Now divide the lower half of
circle D into twice as many equal divisions as quarter
circle K is divided into, and from these points of division
draw perpendiculars <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, etc. And where
these perpendiculars cross the horizontal lines, as <i>d</i>,
will be points through which the curve may be drawn,
three of such points being marked by dots at <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>.
If the student will, after having drawn the curve by
this construction, draw it by the construction that was
explained in connection with Figure 79, he will find
the two methods give so nearly identical curves, that
the latter and more simple method may be used
without sensible error.</p>

<p>Take the drawing of the moulding and divide each
member or step of it by equidistant lines, as <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>,
<i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, in Figure 294; above the moulding draw lines
representing the cutter, and having found the depth
of cutting edge for each member by the construction
shown in Figure 292, finding a separate line, <i>a b</i>, for
each member of the moulding, transfer the depths so
found to the face of the cutter; divide the depth of
each member of the cutter into as many equal divisions
as the corresponding member of the moulding is
divided into, as by lines <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, <i>k</i>, <i>l</i>, <i>m</i>, <i>n</i>. Then draw
vertical lines, as <i>o</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>q</i>, <i>r</i>, etc.; and where these lines
meet the respective lines <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>j</i>, etc., are points in the
curve, such points being marked on the cutter by dots.

<h3><i>EXAMPLES IN LINE-SHADING AND DRAWINGS FOR
LINE-SHADED ENGRAVINGS.</i></h3>


<p>Although in workshop drawings, line-shading is
rarely employed, yet where a design rather than the
particular details of construction is to be shown, line-shading
is a valuable accessory. Figure 295, for
example, is intended to show an arrangement of
idle pulleys to guide belts from one pulley to another;
the principle being that so long as the belt passes to
a pulley moving in line with the line of rotation of
the pulley, the belt will run correctly, although it may
leave the pulley at considerable angle. When a belt
envelops two pulleys that are at a right angle to each
other, two guide pulleys are needed in order that the
belt may, in passing to each pulley, move in the same
plane as the pulley rotates in, and the belt is in this case
given what is termed a quarter twist.</p>

<p>It will be observed that by the line-shading even
the twist of the belt is much more clearly shown than
it would be if left unshaded.</p>

<p>An excellent example of shading is given in Figure
296, which is extracted from the <i>American Machinist</i>,
and represents a cutting tool for a planing machine.
The figure is from a wood engraving, but the effect
may be produced by lines, the black parts being considered
as simply broad black lines.

<p>The drawings from which engravings are made are
drawn to conform to the process by which the engraving
is to be produced. Drawings that are shaded by
plain lines may be engraved by three methods. First,
the drawing may be photo-engraved, in which process
the drawing is photographed on the metal, and every
line appears in the engraving precisely as it appears
in the drawing.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 125px;">
<a name="Fig_296" id="Fig_296"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0277-1.jpg" width="125" height="233" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 296.</span>
</div>

<p>For this kind of engraving the drawing may be
made of any convenient size that is larger than the
size of engraving to be produced, the reduction of size
being produced in the photographing process. Drawings
for photo-engraving require to have the lines jet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[278]</span>
black, and it is to be remembered that if red centrelines
are marked on the drawing, they will be produced
as ordinary black lines in the engraving.</p>

<p>The shading on a drawing to be photo-engraved must
be produced by lines, and not by tints, for tints, whether
of black or of colors, will not photo-engrave properly.</p>

<p>It is generally preferred to make the drawing for a
photo-engraving larger than the engraving that is to
be made from it, a good proportion being to make
the drawing twice the length the engraving is to be.
This serves to reduce the magnitude of any roughness
in the lines of the drawing, and, therefore, to
make the engraving better than the drawing.</p>

<p>The thickness of the lines in the drawing should be
made to suit the amount of reduction to be made, because
the lines are reduced in thickness in the same
proportion as the engraving is reduced from the
drawing. Thus the lines on an engraving reduced to
one-half the dimensions of the drawing would be
one-half as thick as the lines on the drawing.</p>

<p>Drawings for photo-engraving should be made on
smooth-faced paper; as, for example, on Bristol board;
and to make the lines clean and clear, the drawing instruments
should be in the best of condition, and the
paper or Bristol board quite dry. The India rubber
should be used as little as possible on drawings to be
photo-engraved, because, if used before the lines are
inked in, it roughens the surface of the paper, and the
inking lines will be less smooth and even at their
edges; and for this reason it is better not to rub out
any lines until all the lines have been inked in. If used
to excess after the lines have been inked in it serves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[279]</span>
to reduce the blackness of the lines, and may so pale
them that they will not properly photo-engrave.</p>

<p>To make a drawing for an engraver in wood it would
be drawn directly on the face of the box-wood block,
on which it is to be engraved. The surface of the block
is first whitened by a white water color, as Chinese
white. If the drawing that is to be used as a copy is
on sufficiently thin paper, its outline may be traced
over by pencil lines, and the copy may then be laid
face down on the wood block and its edges held to the
block by wax, the pencilled lines being face to the
block. The outline may then be again traced over
with a pencil or pointed instrument, causing the imprint
of the lead pencil lines to be left on the whitened
surface of the block. If the copy is on paper too
thick to be thus employed, a tracing may be made and
used as above; it being borne in mind that the tracing
must be laid with the pencilled lines on the block, because
what is the right hand of the drawing on the
block is the left hand in the print it gives. The
shading on wood blocks is given by tints of India ink
aided by pencilled lines, or of course pencilled lines
only may for less artistic work be used. Another
method is to photograph the drawing direct upon the
surface of the wood block; it is unnecessary, however,
to enter into this part of the subject.</p>

<p>The third method of producing an engraving from
a drawing is by means of what is known as the wax
process. Drawings for this process should be made
on thin paper, for the following reasons: The process
consists, briefly stated, in coating a copper plate with
a layer of wax about 1/32 inch deep, and in drawing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[280]</span>
upon the wax the lines to compose the engraving,
which lines are produced by means of tools that remove
the wax down to the surface of the copper.</p>

<p>The plate and wax are then placed in a battery and
a deposit of copper fills in the lines and surface of
the wax, thus forming the engraving. Now if the
drawing is made on thin paper, the engraver coats the
surface of the drawing with a dry red pigment, and
with a pointed instrument traces over the lines of the
drawing, which causes them to leave a red imprint on
the surface of the wax, and after the drawing is removed
the engraver cuts these imprinted lines in the
wax. If the drawing is on thick paper, this method
of transferring the drawing to the wax cannot be used,
and the engraver may take a tracing from the drawing
and transfer from the tracing to the wax. It is obvious,
also, that for wax engravings the drawing should
be made of the same size that the engraving is required
to be, or otherwise the tracing process described cannot
be used. Figure 297 represents an engraving made
by the wax process from a print from a wood engraving,
and it is obvious that since all the lines drawn on
the wax sink down to the surface of the copper plate,
the shading is virtually composed of lines, the black
surfaces being where the lines have been sufficiently
close together and broad to remove all the wax enclosed
within those surfaces.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 298.</span>
</div>

<p>The wax process is, however, more suitable for engravings
in plain outline only, and is especially excellent
when the parts are small and the lines fall close
together; as, for example, in Figures 298 and 299,
which are engravings of a boiler drilling machine, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[281]</span>
were produced for the <i>American Machinist</i> by tracing
over a wood engraving from London, "Engineering"
in the manner already described. The fineness and
cleanness of the lines in the wax process is here well
illustrated, the disposition of the parts being easily
seen from the engraving, and easily followed in connection
with the following description:</p>

<p>The machine consists of two horizontal bed-plates
A 1 and A 2, made with <b>V</b> slides on top, and placed
at right angles to each other. Upon each of the bed-plates
is fitted a vertical arm B 1 and B 2, each of
which carries two saddles, C 1 and C 2, these being each
adjustable vertically on its respective arm by means
of rack and pinion and hand wheels D 1 and D 2.
The saddles are balanced so that the least possible
exertion is sufficient to adjust them. The vertical
arms, B 1 and B 2, are cast each with a round foot by
which the arms are attached to the square boxes E 1
and E 2, which are fitted to the <b>V</b> slides on the horizontal
beds A 1 and A 2, and are adjustable thereon
by means of screw and ratchet motion F 1 and F 2.
Each of the square boxes has cast on it a small arm
G 1 and G 2, carrying studs upon which run pinions
gearing into the circular racks at the foot of the vertical
arms. The square boxes have each a circular
groove turned in the top to receive the bolts by which
the vertical arms are connected to them, and thus the
vertical arms, and with them the drill spindles N 1 and
N 2, are adjustable radially with the boiler&mdash;the adjustment
being effected by means of the pinions and circular
racks. The pinions are arranged so that they
can be worked with the same screw key that is used
for the bolts in the circular grooves.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>The shell to be drilled is placed upon the circular
table H, which is carried by suitable framework adjustable
by means of screw on a <b>V</b> slide I, placed
at an angle of 45&deg; with the horizontal bed-plates. By
this arrangement, when the table is moved along I, it
will approach to or recede from all the drills equally.
J 1 and J 2 are girders forming additional bearings for
the framework of the table. The bed-plates and slides
for the table are bolted and braced together, making
the whole machine very firm and rigid. Power is applied
to the machine through the cones K 1 and K 2,
working the horizontal and vertical shafts L 1 and L 2,
etc. On the vertical shafts are fitted coarse pitch
worms sliding on feather keys, and carried with the
saddles C 1 and C 2, etc. The worms gearing with the
worm wheels M 1 and M 2 are fitted on the sleeves
of the steel spindles N 1 and N 2. The spindles are
fitted with self-acting motions O 1 and O 2, which are
easily thrown in and out of gear.</p>

<p>The machine is also used for turning the edge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[284]</span>
the flanges which some makers prefer to have on the
end plates of marine boilers. The plates are very
readily fixed to the circular table H, and the edge of
the flange trued up much quicker than by the ordinary
means of chipping. When the machine is used for
this purpose, the cross beam P, which is removable, is
fastened to the two upright brackets R 1 and R 2.
The cross beam is cast with <b>V</b> slides at one side for a
little more than half its length from one end, and on
the opposite side for the same length, but from the
opposite end. The <b>V</b> slides are each fitted with a
tool box S 1 and S 2, having a screw adjustment for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[285]</span>
setting the tool to the depth of cut, and adjustable on
the <b>V</b> slides of the cross beam to the diameter of the
plate to be turned. This arrangement of the machine
is also used for cutting out the furnace mouths in the
boiler ends. The plate is fastened to the circular table,
the centre of the hole to be cut out being placed
over the centre of table; one or both of the tool boxes
may be used. There is sufficient space between the
upright brackets R 1 and R 2, to allow that section of
a boiler end which contains the furnace mouths to revolve
while the holes are being cut out; the plate belonging
to the end of a boiler of the largest diameter
that the machine will take in for drilling. The holes
cut out will be from 2 feet 3 inches in diameter and
upwards. Power for using the turntable is applied
through the cone T. The bevel wheels, worms, worm
wheels, and pinions for driving the tables are of cast
steel, which is necessary for the rough work of turning
the flanges.<span class='pagenum'><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 495px;">
<a name="Fig_299" id="Fig_299"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0287-1.jpg" width="495" height="455" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 299. (Page 275.)</span>
</div>

<p>As to the practical results of using the machine, the
drills are driven at a speed of 340 feet per minute at
the cutting edges. A jet of soapsuds plays on each
drill from an orifice 1/32 in. in diameter, and at a pressure
of 60 lbs. per square inch. A joint composed of two
1-inch plates, and having holes 1 and one-eighth in.
in diameter, can be drilled in about 2-1/2 minutes, and
allowing about half a minute for adjusting the drill,
each drill will do about 20 holes per hour. The
machine is designed to stand any amount of work
that the drills will bear. The time required for putting
on the end of a boiler and turning the flange thereon
(say 14 feet diameter) is about 2-1/2 hours; much,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[289]</span>
however, depends on the state of the flanges, as sometimes
they are very rough, while at others very little
is necessary to true them up. The time required for
putting on the plate containing the furnace mouths
and cutting out three holes 2 feet 6 in. in diameter,
the plate being 1 and one-eighth in. thick, is three
hours. Of course, if several boilers of one size are
being made at the same time, the holes in two or
more of these plates can be cut out at once. The
machine is of such design that it can be placed with
one of the horizontal bed-plates (say A 1), parallel
and close up to a wall of the boiler shop; and when
the turning apparatus is being used, the vertical arm
B 2 can be swiveled half way round on its square box
E 2, and used for drilling and tapping the stay holes
in marine boiler ends after they are put together; of
course sufficient room must be left between bed-plate
A 2, and the wall of boiler shop parallel with it,
to allow for reception of the boiler to be operated
upon.</p>

<p>It would obviously be quite difficult to draw such
drawings as in Figures 298 and 299 on thin paper, so as
to enable the drawing to be traced on the wax direct
by the process before described, unless indeed the
draftsman had considerable experience in fine work;
hence, it is not uncommon to make the drawing large,
and on ordinary drawing paper. The engraver then
has the drawing photographed on the surface of the
wax, and works to the photograph. The letters of
reference in wax engravings are put in by impressing
type in the wax, and in this connection it may be remarked
that the letters I and O should not be used on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[290]</span>
drawings to be engraved by the wax process, unless
they are situated outside the outlines of the drawing,
because the I looks so much like part of a dotted line
that it is often indistinguishable therefrom, while the
O looks like a circle or an ellipse.</p>

<h3><i>SHADING AND COLORING DRAWINGS.</i></h3>


<p>The shading or coloring of drawings by tints is
more employed in large drawings than in small ones,
and in Europe than in the United States; while on the
other hand tinting by means of line-shading is more
employed in the United States than in Europe, and
more on small drawings than on large ones.</p>

<p>Many draftsmen adopt the plan of coloring the
journals of shafts, etc., with a light tint, giving them
the deepest tint at the circumference to give them a
cylindrical appearance. This makes the drawing
much clearer and takes but little time to do, and is
especially advantageous where the parts are small or
on a small scale, so that the lines are comparatively
close together.</p>

<p>For simple shading purposes black tints of various
degrees of darkness may be employed, but it is usual
to tint brass work with yellow. Cast iron with India
ink, wrought iron with Prussian blue, steel with as light
purple tint produced by mixing India ink, Prussian
blue and a tinge of crimson lake. Copper is tinted
red. On plane surfaces an even tint of color is laid,
but if the surfaces are cylindrical they are usually
colored deeper at and near the circumference, and are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[292]</span>
tinted over the colors with light tints of India ink to
show their cylindrical form.</p>

<p>If a drawing is to be colored or shaded with India ink
the paper should be glued all around its edges to the
drawing board, and then dampened evenly all over
with a sponge, which will cause the paper to shrink
and lay close to the surface of the drawing board. If,
in applying a color or a tint, the color dries before the
whole surface is colored, the color will not be of an
equal shade; hence it is necessary before applying the
color to dampen the surface, if it is a large one, so that
the color at one part shall not get dry before there
has been time to go over the whole surface; a more
even depth of color is attained by the application of
several coats of a light tint, than with one coat, giving
the full depth of color. But if the paper is not allowed
to dry sufficiently between the coats, or if it has been
made too wet previous to the application of the colors,
it will run in places, leaving other hollows into which
the color will flow, making darker-colored spots. To
avoid this the paper may be dried somewhat by the
application of clean blotting paper.</p>

<p>To maintain an even shade of color, it is necessary
to slightly stir up the color each time the brush is
dipped into the color saucer or palette, especially when
the coloring is composed of mixed colors, because the
coloring matter is apt to separate from the water and
sink to the bottom.</p>

<p>So, also, in mixing colors it is best to apply the end
of the color to the surface of the palette and not to
apply the brush direct to the cake of color, because
the color is more completely mixed by contact with
<span class='pagenum'>[293]</span>
the palette than it can be by the brush, which may
retain a speck of color that will, unless washed out,
make a streak upon the drawing.</p>

<p>To graduate the depth of tint for a cylindrical surface,
it is best to mix several, as, say three depths or
degrees of tint, and to first use the darkest, applying
it in the direction in which the piece is to be shaded
darkest. The width this dark application should be is
obviously determined by the diameter of the piece.
The next operation is to lighten or draw the part, line
or streak thus dark colored, causing it to get paler
and paler as it approaches the axial line of the piece
or cylinder. This lightening is accomplished as follows:
The dark streak is applied along such a length
of the piece that it will not dry before there has been
time to draw it out or lighten it on the side towards
the axis. A separate brush may then be wetted and
drawn along the edge of the dark streak in short
strokes, causing the color to run outwards and become
lighter as it approaches the axis. It will be found that
during this process the brush will occasionally require
washing in water, because from continuous contact
with the dark streak the tint it contains will darken.
When the first coat has been laid and spread or drawn
out from end to end of the piece, the process may be
repeated two or three times, the most even results
being obtained by making the first dark streak not too
dark, and going over the drawing several times, but
allowing the paper to get very nearly dry between
each coat. In small cylindrical bodies, as, say 1/4 inch
in diameter, the darkest line of shadow may be located
at the lines representing the diameter of the piece, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[294]</span>
in pieces of larger diameter the darkest line may be
located at a short distance from the line that denotes
the diameter or perimeter on the shadow or right-hand
side of the piece, as is shown in many of the engravings
that follow. It is obvious that if a drawing is to have
dimensions marked on it, the coloring or tinting should
not be deep enough to make it difficult to see the dimension
figures.</p>

<p>The size of the brush to be used depends, of course,
upon the size of the piece to be shaded or colored, and
it is best to keep one brush for the dark tint and to
never let the brush dry with the tint in it, as this
makes it harsh. In a good brush the hairs are fine,
lie close together when moistened, are smooth and
yet sufficiently stiff or elastic to bend back slightly
when the pressure is removed. If, when under pressure
and nearly dry, the hairs will separate or the
brush has no elasticity in it, good results cannot be
obtained. All brushes should be well dried after use.</p>

<p>The light in shading is supposed to come in at the
left-hand corner of the drawing, as was explained with
reference to the shade line.</p>

<p>Excellent examples to copy and shade with the
brush are given as follows:</p>

<p>Figure 300 represents a Medart pulley, constructed
by the Hartford Steam Engineering Company; the
arms and hub are cast in one piece, and the rim is a
wrought iron band riveted to the arms, whose ends
are turned or ground true with the hub bore. The
figure is obviously a wood engraving, but it presents
the varying degrees of shade or shadow with sufficient
accuracy to form a good example to copy and brush
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[295]</span><span class='pagenum'>[295]</span>
shade with India ink. Figure 301 represents a similar
pulley with a double set of arms, forming an excellent
example in perspective drawing, as well as for brush-shading.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;">
<a name="Fig_300" id="Fig_300"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0295-1.jpg" width="192" height="217" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 300.</span>
</div>

<p>In brush-shading as with line-shading, the difficulties
increase with an increase in the size of the piece, and
the learner will find that after he has succeeded tolerably
well in shading these small pulleys, it will be quite
difficult, but excellent practice to shade the large pulley
in Figure 302.</p>

<p>One of the principal considerations is to not let the
color dry at the edges in one part while continuing
the shading in another part of the same surface, hence
it is best to begin at the edge or outline of the drawing
and carry the work forward as quickly as possible,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[296]</span>
occasionally slightly wetting with water edges that
require to be left while the shading is proceeding in
another direction.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 214px;">
<a name="Fig_301" id="Fig_301"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0296-1.jpg" width="214" height="214" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 301.</span>
</div>

<p>When it is required to show by the shading that the
surfaces are highly polished, the lighter parts of the
shading are made to contain what may be termed
splashes of lighter and darker shadow, as in Figure
303, which represents an oil cup, having a brass casing
enclosing a glass cylinder, which appears through the
openings in the brass shell.</p>

<p>Figure 304 represents an iron planing machine
whose line-shading is so evenly effected that it affords
an excellent example of shading. Its parts are similar
to those shown in the iron planer in Figure 297, save
that it carries two sliding heads, so as to enable the
use, simultaneously, of two cutting tools.

<p>A superior example in shading is shown in Figures
305 and 306, which represent a plan and a sectional
view of the steam-cylinder of a Blake's patent direct-acting
steam-pump. The construction of the parts is
as follows: A is the steam-piston, H 1 and H are the
cylinder steam-passages; M is the cylinder exhaust
port.</p>

<p>The main valve, whose movement alternately opens
the ports for the admission of steam to, and the escape
of steam from, the main cylinder, is divided into two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[303]</span><span class='pagenum'>[303]</span>
parts, one of which, C, slides upon a seat on the main
cylinder, and at the same time affords a seat for the
other part, D, which slides upon the upper face of C.
As shown in the engravings, D is at the left-hand end
of its stroke, and C at the opposite or right-hand end
of its stroke. Steam from the steam-chest, J, is therefore
entering the right-hand end of the main cylinder
through the ports E and H, and the exhaust is escaping
through the ports H 1, E 1, K and M, which causes
the main piston A to move from right to left. When
this <i>piston</i> has nearly reached the left-hand end of its
cylinder, the tappet arm, T, attached to the piston-rod,
comes in contact with, and moves the valve rod collar
O 1 and valve rod P, and thus causes C, together with
the supplemental valves R and S S 1, which form, with
C, <i>one casting</i>, to be moved from right to left. This
movement causes steam to be admitted to the left-hand
end of the supplemental cylinder, whereby its piston B
will be forced towards the right, carrying D to the opposite
or right-hand end of its stroke; for the movement
of S closes N (the steam-port leading to the
right-hand end), and the movement of S 1 opens N 1
(the steam-port leading to the opposite or left-hand
end), at the same time the movement of V opens the
right-hand end of this cylinder to the exhaust, through
the exhaust ports X and Z. The parts C and D now
have positions opposite to those shown in the engravings,
and steam is therefore entering the main cylinder
through the ports E 1 and H 1, and escaping through
the ports H, E, K and M, which causes the main piston
A to move in the opposite direction, or from left to
right, and operations similar to those already described
<span class='pagenum'><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[305]</span><span class='pagenum'>[305]</span>
will follow, when the piston approaches the right-hand
end of its cylinder. By this simple arrangement the
pump is rendered positive in its action; that is, it will
instantly start and continue working the moment steam
is admitted to the steam-chest, while at the same time
the piston is enabled to move as slowly as the nature
of the duty may require. It will be noted that in Figure
305, the ports of C are shown through D, whose location
is marked by dark shading. This obviously is
not correct, because D being above C should be
shaded lighter than C, and again the ports E 1 and K
could not show dark through the port D. They might,
of course, be shown by dotted outlines, but they would
not appear to such advantage, and on this account it
is permissible where artistic effect is sought, the object
being to subserve the shading to making the mechanism
and its operation clearly and readily understood.</p>

<h3><i>EXAMPLES IN ENGINE WORK.</i></h3>


<p>In the figures from 308 to 328 inclusive are given
three examples in engine work, all these drawings
being from <i>The American Machinist</i>. Figures 308 to
314 represent drawings of an automatic high speed
engine designed and made by Professor John E. and
William A. Sweet, of Syracuse, New York. Figure
308 is a side and 309 an end view of the engine.
Upon a bed-plate is bolted two straight frames, between
which, at their upper ends, the cylinder is secured
by bolts. The guides for the cross-head are
bolted to the frame, which enables them to be readily
removed to be replaned when necessary. The hand
wheel and rod to the right are to operate the stop-cock
for turning on and off the steam to the steam-chest.</p>

<p>The objects of the design are as follows: Figure
310 is a vertical section of the cylinder through the
valve face, also showing the valve in section, and it
will be seen that the lower steam passage enters the
cylinder its full depth below the inside bottom, and
that the whole inside bottom surface of the cylinder
slopes or inclines towards the entrance of this passage.
The object of this is to overcome the difficulty experienced
from the accumulation of water in the cylinder,
<span class='pagenum'>[316]</span>
which, in the vertical engine, is usually a source of
considerable annoyance and frequently the cause of
accident.</p>

<p>Any water that may be present in the bottom finds
its way by gravity to the port steam entrance, and is
forced out by and with the exhaust steam at or before
the commencement of the return stroke.</p>

<p>To assist in the escape of water from the top of the
cylinder, the piston is made quite crowning at that
end, the effect of which is to collect the water in a
narrow band, instead of spreading it over a large surface.
This materially assists in its escape, and at the
same time presents a large surface for the distribution
of any water that may not find its way out in advance
of the piston.</p>

<p>The piston is a single casting unusually long and
light, and is packed with four spring rings of 3/8 inch
square brass wire.</p>

<p>The valve is a simple rectangular plate, working
between the valve face and a cover plate, the cover
plate being held in its proper position, relative to the
back of the valve, by steam pressure against its outer
surface, and by resting against loose distance pieces
between its inner surface and the valve seat. This
construction admits of the valve leaving the seat, if
necessary, to relieve the cylinder from water, as in the
instance of priming, and also, by the reduction of these
pieces, admits of ready adjustment to contact, should
it become necessary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 301px;">
<a name="Fig_311" id="Fig_311"></a>
<img src="images/drawing-0317-1.jpg" width="301" height="431" alt=""/>
<span class="caption">Fig. 311&mdash;Valve Motion.</span>
</div>

<p>The cover plate is provided with recesses on its
inner surface which exactly correspond with the ports
in the valve face, and the corresponding ports and recesses
<span class='pagenum'>[318]</span>
are kept in communication with each other by
means of relief passages in the valve. From this it
will be seen that the valve is subjected to equal and
balanced pressure on each of its sides, and hence, is in
equilibrium.</p>

<p>The valve is operated through the valve motion,
shown in Figure 311, the eccentric rod of which hooks
on a slightly tapered block that turns on the pin of the
rock arm, like an ordinary journal box.</p>

<p>The expansion, or cut-off, is automatically regulated
by the operation of the governor in swinging the
slotted eccentric in a manner substantially equivalent
to moving it across the shaft, but is however favorably
modified by the arrangement of the rock arm, which,
in combination with the other motions, neutralizes the
unfavorable operation of the usual shifting eccentric,
and which, in connection with the large double port
opening, provides for a good use of steam from 0 to
3/4 stroke.</p>

<p>The governor shown in Figure 312 is of the disc
and single ball type, the centrifugal force of the ball
being counteracted by a powerful spring. Friction is
reduced to a minimum in the governor connection, by
introducing steel rollers and hardened steel plates in
such a manner as to provide rolling instead of sliding
motion.</p>

<p>In order that a governor shall correctly perform its
functions, it is unquestionably necessary that it have
power largely in excess of the work required of it, and
also that the friction shall represent a very low percentage
of that power. In respect to this, especial
means have been employed to reduce the friction; the
<span class='pagenum'>[319]</span>
valve being balanced, requires but little power to move
it, while the governor ball being made heavy for the
purpose of counterbalancing the weight of the eccentric
and strap, its centrifugal force when the engine is
at full speed is enormous, the spring to counteract it
having to sustain from <i>two to three thousand pounds</i>.
Under these circumstances, as might be expected, the
regulation is remarkably good. This is a very important
<span class='pagenum'>[320]</span>
consideration in an engine working under the
conditions of a roll-train engine.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 313&mdash;Section of Pillow Block.</span>
</div>

<p>Figure 313 represents a section of the pillow block
box, crank-pin and wheel, together with the main
journal. It will be seen that the end of the box next
the crank wheel has a circular groove around its outside,
and that a corresponding groove in the crank
wheel projects over this groove. From this latter
groove an oil hole of liberal size extends, as shown, to
the surface of the crank-pin. Any oil placed at the
upper part of the groove on the box finds its way by
<span class='pagenum'>[323]</span>
gravity into the groove in the crank wheel, and is carried
by centrifugal force to the outside surface of the
crank-pin; so that whatever other means of lubrication
may be employed, this one will always be positive in
its action. This cut also shows the manner in which
the box overlaps the main journal and forms the oil
reservoir.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 314&mdash;Connecting Rod. (Page 295.)</span>
</div>

<p>Another feature in the construction of this box is
the means by which it is made to adjust itself in line
with the shaft. It will be observed that it rests on the
bottom of the jaws of the frame on two inclined surfaces,
which form equal angles with the axis of the
shaft when in its normal position, and that by
moving longitudinally in either direction, as may be
necessary, the box will accommodate itself to a change
in the alignment of the shaft. In order that it may be
free to move for this purpose it is not fitted with the
usual fore and aft flanges. By this means any slight
derangement, as in either the outboard or inboard
bearing wearing down the fastest, is taken care of, the
movement of the box on the inclined surfaces being
for this purpose equivalent to the operation of a ball
and socket bearing.</p>

<p>Figure 314 gives a side and an edge view of the
connecting rod, the rod being in section in the edge
view, and the brasses in section lined in both views.</p>

<p>The cross-head pin, it will be observed, is tapered,
and is drawn home in the cross-head by a bolt; the
sides of the pin are flattened somewhat where the
journal is, so that the pin may not wear oval, as it is
apt to do, because of the pull and thrust strain of the
rod brasses falling mainly upon the top and bottom of
<span class='pagenum'>[324]</span>
the journal, where the most wear therefore takes
place. The brasses at the crossed end are set up by
a wedge adjustable by means of the screw bolts
shown. The cross-head wrist pin being removable
from the cross-head enables the upper end of the rod
to have a solid end, since it can be passed into place
in the crossed and the wrist pin inserted through the
two. The lower ends of the connecting-rod and the
crank-pin possess a peculiar feature, inasmuch as by
enlarging the diameter of the crank-pin, the ends of
the brasses overlap, to a certain extent, the ends of
the journal, thus holding the oil and affording increased
lubrication. The segments that partly envelop the
cross-head pin and crank-pin, and are section lined in
two directions, producing crossing section lines, or
small squares, show that the brasses are lined with
babbitt metal, which is represented by this kind of
cross-hatching. These drawings are sufficiently open
and clear to form very good examples to copy and to
trace on tracing paper.</p>

</div>

<p>Figures 315, 316 and 317 represent, in place upon
its setting, a 200 horse-power horizontal steam-boiler
for a stationary engine, and are the design of William
H. Hoffman. The cross-sectional view of the boiler shell
in Figure 315 shows the arrangement of the
tubes, which, having clear or unobstructed passages
between the vertical rows of tubes, permits the steam
to rise freely and assists the circulation of the water.
The dry pipe (which is also shown in Figure 316) is a
perforated pipe through which the steam passes to the
engine cylinder, its object being to carry off the steam
as dry as possible; that is to say, without its carrying
<span class='pagenum'>[328]</span>
away with the steam any entrained water that may be
held in suspension. Figure 316 is a side elevation
with the setting shown in section, and Figure 317 is
an end view of the boiler and setting at the furnace
end. The boiler is supported on each side by channel
iron columns, these being riveted to the boiler shell
angle pieces which rest upon the columns. The heat
and products of combustion pass from the furnace
along the bottom of the boiler, and at the end pass into
<span class='pagenum'>[329]</span>
and through the tubes and thence over the top of the
boiler to the chimney flue. There is shown in the
bridge wall an opening, and its service is to admit air
to the gases after they have passed the bridge wall, and
thus complete the combustion of such gases as may
<span class='pagenum'>[341]</span>
have remained unconsumed in the furnace. The
cleansing door at one end and that lined with asbestos
at the other, are to admit the passage of the tube
cleaners. The asbestos at the top of the boiler shell
is to protect it from any undue rise in temperature,
steam being a poorer conductor of heat than water,
and it being obvious that if one side of the boiler is
hotter than the other it expands more from the heat
and becomes longer, causing the boiler to bend, which
strains and weakens it. The sides of the setting are
composed of a double row of brick walls with an air
space of three inches between them, the object being
to prevent as far as possible the radiation of heat
from the walls. The brick-staves are simply stays to
hold the brick work together and prevent its cracking,
as it is apt, in the absence of staying, to do.</p>

<p>Figures from 318 to 330 are working drawings of a

Hoffman.</p>

<p>Figure 318 represents a plan and a side view of the
bed-plate with the main bearing and the guide bars in
place. The cylinder is bolted at the stuffing box
end to the bed-plate, and is supported at the outer end
by an expansion link pivoted to the bed-plate. The
main bearing is provided with a screw for adjusting
the height of the bottom piece of the bearing, and
thus taking up the wear. The guide bars are held to
the bed in the middle as well as at each end.</p>

<p>A view of the steam-chest side of the cylinder is
given in Figure 323, and a horizontal cross section
of the cylinder, the steam-chest and the valves, is
shown in Figure 324. The main valves are connected
by a right and left hand screw, to enable their adjustment,
as are also the cut-off valves.</p>

<p>Figures 325 and 326 show the cam wrist plate and
the cut-off mechanism. The cam wrist plate, which is
of course vibrated by the eccentric rod, has an inclined
groove, whose walls are protected from wear by steel
shoes. In this groove is a steel roller upon a pin attached
to the bell crank operating the main valve stem.
The operation of the groove is to accelerate the
motion imparted from the eccentric to the valve at
one part of the latter's travel, and retard it at another,
the accelerated portion being during the opening of
the port for steam admission, and during its closure
for cutting off, which enables the employment of a
smaller steam-port than would otherwise be the case.</p>

<p>The shaft for the cam plate is carried in a bearing
at one end, and fits in a socket at the other, the socket
and bearing being upon a base plate that is bolted to
the bed-plate of the engine; a side view of the construction
being shown in Figure 327.</p>

<p>Figure 328 represents the cross-head, whose wrist
pin is let into the cross-head cheeks, so that it may be
removed to be turned up true. The clip is to prevent
the piston rod nut from loosening back of itself.</p>

<p>Figure 329 represents a side view; and Figure 329 <i>a</i> a
section through the centre of the eccentric and strap.
<span class='pagenum'>[362]</span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[363]</span></p>

<p>The eccentric is let into the strap and is provided with
an eye to receive a circular nut by means of which
the length of the eccentric rod may be adjusted, a
hexagon nut being upon the other or outer end of the
eye.</p>

<p>Figure 330 shows the construction of the connecting
rod, the brasses of which are adjustable to take
up the wear and to maintain them to correct length,
notwithstanding the wear, by means of a key on each
side of each pair of brasses, the keys being set up by
nuts and secured by check nuts.
